## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Cython → nanobind migration** -- All native bindings (llama, whisper, stable-diffusion, embedded mongoose server) rewritten from Cython to [nanobind](https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind). The public Python surface is preserved: callers continue to `from inferna.llama.llama_cpp import ...`, `from inferna.whisper.whisper_cpp import ...`, `from inferna.sd import ...`, etc., with the same class names, method signatures, enum constants, and module-level functions. **Build no longer requires Cython at all** -- `[build-system].requires` is now `["scikit-build-core", "nanobind>=2.12.0"]`. The `cython-cmake` dep, the `Cython` dev dep, the entire `add_cython_extension` CMake helper, `find_package(Cython)`, `include(UseCython)`, and the `scripts/cmake/` Cython helper modules are all removed. Module layout is now uniform across all three upstreams: `_<name>_native.cpp` (nanobind C++ TU) + `<name>_cpp.py` / `stable_diffusion.py` / `embedded.py` (public Python facade). Pure-Python helpers (`download_model`, `NgramCache`, memory pools, speculative decoder) extracted from the old `llama_cpp.pyx` into standalone modules (`_python_helpers.py`, `_speculative.py`) so they can be linted/debugged without invoking the C++ build. Wheel size dropped from 12.3 MB to 11.6 MB (~6%). 1,472 tests pass, 31 skipped, 0 failed against the new bindings. Full post-mortem in `NANOBIND.md`. Deleted: `llama_cpp.pyx` (4318 LOC), 5 `.pxd` files (~2300 LOC), 3 `.pxi` files (~975 LOC), `whisper_cpp.pyx`, `whisper.pxd`, `stable_diffusion.pyx`, `stable_diffusion.pxd`, `embedded.pyx`, `mongoose.pxd`.

- **Native binding code style consistency pass** -- Follow-up cleanup after the Cython→nanobind migration to make all five native TUs (`_llama_native.cpp`, `_llama_native_mtmd.cpp`, `_llama_native_tts.cpp`, `_llama_native_enums.cpp`, `_whisper_native.cpp`, `_sd_native.cpp`) follow the same conventions. In `_whisper_native.cpp`: removed 6 `wp_*` static helpers (anonymous-union accessors for `whisper_full_params.greedy`/`beam_search` -- the lambdas now read `s.c.greedy.best_of` etc. directly) and 6 `py_*` static helpers (`py_version`, `py_print_system_info`, `py_lang_max_id`, `py_lang_id`, `py_lang_str`, `py_lang_str_full`) inlined as `m.def` lambdas matching the llama/sd style; inlined the 25-line `py_ggml_backend_load_all` body the same way; renamed the no-op log callback to `_whisper_no_log_cb` to match the `_llama_no_log_cb` convention. In `_sd_native.cpp`: removed dead `get_c_image()` static helper. In `_python_helpers.py`: removed a `getattr` fallback dance around `LlamaBatch._n_tokens` that was needed during the migration but is now dead code (the nanobind `LlamaBatch` always exposes `_n_tokens` and `n_tokens_capacity`). No `py_*` or `wp_*` style prefixed wrappers remain; named static helpers are reserved for genuinely-substantial logic (e.g. `make_enum_dict` in sd) or ABI-required `extern "C"` callbacks. No behavioural change, no public-surface change, all 1,472 tests still pass.

### Added

- **stable-diffusion.cpp hires-fix two-pass generation exposed** -- Mirrors the upstream `sd_hires_params_t` struct (added in stable-diffusion.cpp release master-587-b8bdffc) onto `SDImageGenParams`. New `HiresUpscaler` IntEnum (10 modes: `NONE`, `LATENT`, `LATENT_NEAREST`, `LATENT_NEAREST_EXACT`, `LATENT_ANTIALIASED`, `LATENT_BICUBIC`, `LATENT_BICUBIC_ANTIALIASED`, `LANCZOS`, `NEAREST`, `MODEL`). Eight new properties on `SDImageGenParams`: `hires_enabled`, `hires_upscaler`, `hires_model_path`, `hires_scale`, `hires_target_size` (tuple), `hires_steps`, `hires_denoising_strength`, `hires_tile_size`. New `set_hires_fix(enabled=True, upscaler=None, scale=2.0, model_path=None, target_width=0, target_height=0, steps=0, denoising_strength=0.7, tile_size=128)` convenience method matching the upstream defaults. `SDContext.generate()`, `text_to_images()`, and `text_to_image()` gain two minimal kwargs (`hires_fix: bool = False`, `hires_scale: float = 2.0`) for the common case; full configuration remains available via `SDImageGenParams` directly. `HiresUpscaler` re-exported from `inferna.sd`. 4 new tests in `tests/test_sd.py::TestSDImageGenParamsExtended` cover defaults, individual setters, the `set_hires_fix()` bundle, and enum-value pinning to detect future C-side enum reordering.

- **Two-layer generation cancellation on `LLM`** -- New `LLM.cancel()` and `LLM.cancel_requested` (property) provide thread-safe interruption of in-flight generations. Two cooperating layers, both wired by `cancel()`:
  - *Between tokens (Python).* `LLM` carries a `threading.Event` that `_generate_stream` clears at entry and polls each iteration of the per-token loop, plus once before each prompt-batch decode. Latency is sub-millisecond in steady-state generation.
  - *Mid-decode (C, nogil).* `LlamaContext` gains a private `bint _cancel_flag` C field and a new `install_cancel_callback()` method that registers a `noexcept nogil` ggml_abort_callback (`_cancel_flag_callback` in `src/inferna/llama/llama_cpp.pyx`) reading the flag by pointer. The callback is auto-installed by `LLM._ensure_context()` on every context creation. Setting the flag aborts the in-progress `llama_decode` from inside ggml's compute graph -- needed because a single decode of a long prompt prefill (tens of thousands of tokens, slow hardware) can otherwise run for seconds before the next token-boundary poll fires. The flag is also exposed Python-side as `LlamaContext.cancel` (read/write `bool` property) for direct testing and lower-level callers. The pre-existing user-callable `LlamaContext.set_abort_callback(py_callback)` is unchanged; calling it overrides the auto-installed cancel hook (documented).
  - The flag is auto-cleared at the start of each `_generate_stream` call, so a `cancel()` issued before the next generation does not leak into it.
  - Tests in `tests/test_cancel.py` cover between-token cancel, auto-clear between generations, idempotent double-cancel, before-generation behavior, and the `LlamaContext.cancel` property round-trip. 5 tests, ~3.6s under the default test model.
  - Motivating use case: cancel-on-disconnect in a streaming HTTP server (e.g. `inferna-desktop`'s FastAPI sidecar) where the client closing the SSE connection should free the GPU rather than letting `max_tokens` run to completion.

- **`LLM.install_sigint_handler()` opt-in CLI helper** -- Installs a SIGINT handler that calls `self.cancel()`, so Ctrl-C interrupts generation cleanly even mid-`llama_decode` rather than waiting for the C call to return before `KeyboardInterrupt` can be raised. Returns a `_SigintHandle` usable as a context manager (`with llm.install_sigint_handler(): ...`) or imperatively via `.restore()`. The previous handler is saved and restored on exit, so the helper composes safely with Click, Jupyter, asyncio's signal handling, and other consumers of SIGINT. Opt-in by design: inferna otherwise leaves signal handlers alone, since libraries that mutate them implicitly are a known footgun. 3 additional tests in `tests/test_cancel.py` cover handler restoration, actual signal delivery flipping `cancel_requested`, and idempotent restore.

### Changed

- **llama.cpp upgraded from b8833 to b8931** -- Public `llama.h` API removed two symbols, both relocated into the (non-public) common helpers as `fit.h`: `llama_memory_breakdown_print` -> `common_memory_breakdown_print`, and `llama_params_fit` (+ `llama_params_fit_status` enum) -> `common_fit_params` (+ `common_params_fit_status`). inferna declines to link `libllama-common.a` (not part of llama.cpp's public API), so both are dropped from the Cython surface rather than rebound: `LlamaContext.print_memory_breakdown()` removed from `src/inferna/llama/llama_cpp.pyx`, and the corresponding `cdef extern` blocks removed from `src/inferna/llama/llama.pxd`. Also: `llama_model_quantize_default_params().ftype` upstream default changed from `LLAMA_FTYPE_MOSTLY_Q5_1 (9)` to `LLAMA_FTYPE_MOSTLY_Q8_0 (7)`; `tests/test_params.py::test_default_model_quantize_params` updated to match. `mtmd.h` upstream constness sweep -- `mtmd_decode_use_non_causal`, `mtmd_decode_use_mrope`, `mtmd_support_vision`, `mtmd_support_audio`, `mtmd_get_audio_sample_rate` now take `const mtmd_context *`; `src/inferna/llama/mtmd.pxd` decls updated. `struct mtmd_decoder_pos` gained a reserved `uint32_t z` field, and `mtmd_image_tokens_get_decoder_pos` gained a `llama_pos pos_0` parameter (now `(image_tokens, pos_0, i)`); both reflected in `mtmd.pxd`. Neither is called from any `.pyx`/`.pxi` in inferna today, so no Python-surface change.

- **GPU-wheel `workflow_dispatch` inputs renamed for platform consistency** -- Linux backend inputs in `build-gpu-wheels.yml` and `build-gpu-wheels-abi3.yml` previously had bare names (`cuda`, `rocm`, `sycl`, `vulkan`) while Windows and macOS variants already carried a platform suffix. Linux inputs are now `cuda_linux`, `rocm_linux`, `sycl_linux`, `vulkan_linux`, so every backend input follows the `<backend>_<platform>` convention. **Breaking** for anyone triggering the workflow via `gh workflow run ... -f cuda=true` (use `-f cuda_linux=true`) or with bookmarked "Run workflow" UI presets (re-tick the Linux boxes once).

## [0.2.13]

### Added

- **[qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) reference adapter for `VectorStoreProtocol`** -- `QdrantVectorStore` (`src/inferna/rag/stores/qdrant.py`) implements the protocol against `qdrant_client.QdrantClient`; first worked example of the multi-backend seam, drop-in via `RAG(store=...)`. Source-dedup lives in per-point payload fields. Supports `:memory:`, on-disk, and remote transports. Lazy-imported so `import inferna.rag` stays free of the optional dep; gated behind the `qdrant` dependency group. Tests in `tests/test_rag_qdrant.py` skip when `qdrant-client` isn't installed; optional integration tests run against a live server via `INFERNA_QDRANT_URL`. End-to-end verified against Qdrant 1.17.1.

- **`RerankerProtocol` + pipeline-integrated reranking** -- `RerankerProtocol` (`score`, `rerank`, `close`) added to `src/inferna/rag/types.py`; `Reranker` now inherits it. `RAGConfig` gains `rerank`, `rerank_top_k`, `reranker` fields validated in `__post_init__`. `RAGPipeline._retrieve` is the single retrieval site used by `query`, `stream`, and `retrieve`; when enabled, fetches `rerank_top_k` candidates and calls `reranker.rerank(...)`. Default `rerank=False` preserves existing behaviour.

- **ccache on CPU cibw workflows** -- `hendrikmuhs/ccache-action@v1.2` wired into `build-cibw.yml` and `build-cibw-abi3.yml` for Linux and macOS, matching the GPU workflows. Biggest payoff on the cp310/311/312/313/314 axis, where the same C/C++ source is recompiled per Python version within a single run. Windows MSVC deliberately excluded pending a separate PDB / cmake-integration investigation.

- **Concurrency groups on CPU cibw workflows** -- `build-cibw.yml` and `build-cibw-abi3.yml` now cancel in-flight runs on the same ref when a new push arrives, matching the pattern on the GPU workflows.

- **CI link-test guardrail for Windows GPU wheels** -- `build-gpu-wheels.yml` and `build-gpu-wheels-abi3.yml` add a smoke step that walks every `inferna*.libs/ggml-*.dll` and `ctypes.WinDLL(path)`-loads it with no flags -- exactly the `LoadLibraryW(path, NULL, 0)` semantics ggml uses in C. Catches delvewheel/PATH regressions on GPU-less runners where `inferna info` exits 0 even when a backend DLL fails.

### Changed

- **`scripts/manage.py` backend-option builders refactored** -- Introduced `GgmlBuilder(Builder)` holding shared GGML_* env-flag -> CMake-option helpers; `LlamaCppBuilder`, `WhisperCppBuilder`, and `StableDiffusionCppBuilder` now extend it, collapsing three ~100-line duplicated `get_backend_cmake_options()` methods. Net -98 lines, no change to emitted CMake options under any GGML_* combination.

### Fixed

- **Windows GPU wheels failed to load any non-CPU ggml backend at runtime** -- `inferna_vulkan` (and `inferna-cuda12` by the same mechanism) silently fell back to CPU-only because `ggml_backend_load()` uses `LoadLibraryW(path, NULL, 0)`, which does not include the loaded DLL's own directory in the search path. Windows resolved `ggml-vulkan-<hash>.dll` itself but not its delvewheel-bundled siblings (`ggml-base`, `vulkan-1`, `msvcp140`). delvewheel's `os.add_dll_directory()` patch only helps callers passing `LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_USER_DIRS`, which ggml does not. `src/inferna/_internal/backend_dl.py` now prepends each discovered `inferna*.libs/` to `PATH` once on Windows before the first `ggml_backend_load()` call. No-op on Linux/macOS.

- **Stale `hashFiles()` paths in workflow cache keys** -- Typos and a rename-drift (`build-cibw.yaml` vs `.yml`, `build-abi3.yml` vs `build-cibw-abi3.yml`, non-existent `build-gpu-wheels2.yml` in three places) caused affected cache keys to collapse to a prefix with no workflow-file component, so workflow / `manage.py` edits never invalidated the `thirdparty/` cache. All 17 `hashFiles()` refs now resolve; 5 stale prose mentions cleaned up.

## [0.2.12]

### Added

- **Experimental abi3 (stable-ABI) wheel build path** -- New `INFERNA_ABI3` CMake option (default `OFF`) produces a single `cp312-abi3-<plat>` wheel importable on Python 3.12+, collapsing the Python-version axis of the wheel matrix. The default per-version build is unchanged. Floor is 3.12 because Cython's memoryview boilerplate needs `Py_buffer` (stable ABI in 3.11) and the fast-call path uses vectorcall (stable ABI in 3.12); 3.10/3.11 users stay on the per-version build until EOL. See `docs/dev/abi3.md`.

- **Experimental CI workflows for abi3 wheel builds** -- `.github/workflows/build-cibw-abi3.yml` (CPU) and `build-gpu-wheels-abi3.yml` (GPU backends), mirroring `build-cibw.yml` and `build-gpu-wheels.yml`. Both are opt-in via `workflow_dispatch`, run alongside the per-version workflows without collision, and include a cross-version smoke matrix (3.12/3.13/3.14) plus a platform-aware abi3 tag guard on every installed extension.

- **`make dev-abi3` and `make wheel-abi3` targets** -- Convenience wrappers around the `INFERNA_ABI3=ON` + `wheel.py-api=cp312` config settings.

### Changed

- **Wheel packaging normalized to the canonical delocate/auditwheel/delvewheel pattern** -- Previously inferna installed dependent dynamic libs directly into `inferna/llama/` inside the wheel via an `install(DIRECTORY)` rule, a build-tree SONAME-dereferencing staging loop in `CMakeLists.txt` (`_wheel_staged_dylibs` + `file(REAL_PATH)` + `configure_file(COPYONLY)`), and `manage.py stage_dylibs` / `fix_macos_wheel_rpaths` subcommands wired into `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD_MACOS` / `CIBW_REPAIR_WHEEL_COMMAND_MACOS`. That scheme duplicated libs (one in `inferna/llama/` plus one in `inferna/.dylibs/` after delocate ran, ~4x bloat) and required per-extension `@loader_path` / `@loader_path/..` / `@loader_path/../llama` / `$ORIGIN/../llama` rpath gymnastics that diverged between macOS and Linux.

  Under the new pattern, CMake installs no dylibs into the package directory at all. Extensions carry uniform `BUILD_RPATH` and `INSTALL_RPATH` pointing at the absolute build-tree lib dirs (`${LLAMACPP_LIB}`, `${WHISPERCPP_LIB}`, `${SDCPP_LIB}`, `${LLAMACPP_DYLIB_DIR}`). The platform-native repair tool then resolves `@rpath/libX` references during cibuildwheel repair and is the single authority for what lands in the final wheel:
  - `delocate-wheel` (macOS) → `inferna/.dylibs/` with `@loader_path/../.dylibs/...`
  - `auditwheel` (Linux) → `inferna.libs/` with `$ORIGIN/...`
  - `delvewheel` (Windows) → `inferna_<backend>.libs/` via `--add-path` pointing at `thirdparty/{llama.cpp,whisper.cpp,stable-diffusion.cpp}/dynamic/`

  One copy per lib in one place. Editable installs continue to work because the build-tree paths are valid on the dev host. Removed along with the old scheme: `manage.py stage_dylibs`, `manage.py fix_macos_wheel_rpaths`, the `_inject_loader_path_rpath` helper, the `_wheel_staged_dylibs` staging dir, the SONAME dereferencing loop, the `install(DIRECTORY)` rule, and all per-extension rpath overrides. Added: `_sanitize_macos_dylib_rpaths` strips upstream llama.cpp's absolute build-tree `LC_RPATH` entries from copied dylibs (they caused delocate's two-paths-same-basename collisions), and `libggml-blas` is appended to `_OPTIONAL_DYLIB_NAMES` on Apple non-Metal builds so delocate can resolve GGML's auto-linked Accelerate chain. See `docs/dev/packaging.md`.

- **`build-new-wheels.yml` now produces working Windows-CUDA, Windows-Vulkan, and macOS-Intel Vulkan GPU wheels** -- All three variants were broken in this workflow. Fixes span `.github/workflows/build-new-wheels.yml`, `scripts/manage.py`, and `CMakeLists.txt`:

  - **Windows CMake configure.** `_dylib_ext` branched only on `APPLE` vs. Linux, so Windows searched `thirdparty\llama.cpp\dynamic\` for `libllama.so` despite the dir containing `llama.dll`. Added a `WIN32` branch (`_dylib_ext=dll`, `_dylib_prefix=""`), guarded the soname glob with `NOT WIN32`, and updated error messages.

  - **Windows MSVC linking.** Upstream llama.cpp Windows release zips ship only `.dll` files, no `.lib` import libs. `LlamaCppBuilder._generate_import_libs()` now synthesizes the missing `.lib` files post-download via the standard MSVC pipeline (`dumpbin /exports` → `.def` → `lib /def:<file>.def /out:<file>.lib /machine:X64`). Tooling is resolved via `vswhere.exe` at its fixed install path under `ProgramFiles(x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\` rather than `shutil.which`, because cibuildwheel's MSVC env is activated only for the main build step — `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD_WINDOWS` runs outside it. The method is a no-op if a future upstream release ships `.lib` files itself.

  - **Windows CUDA runtime DLLs.** `download_release()` now also fetches the companion `cudart-llama-bin-win-cuda-{cuda_ver}-{arch_tag}.zip` asset (cudart, cublas, cublasLt) so `delvewheel` can resolve `ggml-cuda.dll`'s runtime deps. The cudart asset is keyed only on `cuda_ver`+`arch_tag`, so it doesn't churn on `LLAMACPP_VERSION` bumps.

  - **Windows Vulkan asset detection.** `_release_asset_name()` returned `None` for Windows+Vulkan under a stale "no prebuilt exists" comment; it now returns the `llama-*-bin-win-vulkan-*.zip` asset that upstream ships.

  - **Windows `link_mode`.** Both Windows jobs were hardcoded to static linking (`WITH_DYLIB=0`, no `--dynamic`), producing 200+ MB `.pyd` files. They now honour the workflow's `link_mode` input (default `dynamic`) and extend `CIBW_REPAIR_WHEEL_COMMAND_WINDOWS` with `delvewheel --add-path` for each of the three `thirdparty/*/dynamic` dirs.

  - **macOS Vulkan libvulkan rewrite.** Every extension and the bundled `libggml-vulkan.dylib` carried an absolute `LC_LOAD_DYLIB /usr/local/opt/vulkan-loader/lib/libvulkan.1.dylib` baked in by the runner's `brew install vulkan-loader`. The new `manage.py fix_macos_vulkan_wheel` subcommand (chained after `delocate-wheel`) rewrites every `.so`/`.dylib`'s libvulkan load command to `@rpath/libvulkan.1.dylib`, adds `LC_RPATH` entries for both `/opt/homebrew/lib` and `/usr/local/lib`, ad-hoc re-signs each mutated binary, and repacks the wheel via `wheel pack`. Users on either Homebrew prefix can now `brew install vulkan-loader` and import inferna.

### Fixed

- **Linux GPU wheels shipped without project dynamic libs** -- `.github/workflows/build-gpu-wheels.yml` passed `--exclude libllama.so.0 --exclude libggml*.so.0 --exclude libmtmd.so.0 --exclude libggml-<backend>.so` to `auditwheel repair` for all four backends (CUDA, ROCm, SYCL, Vulkan). Those are project libs, not system/driver libs. Excluding them told auditwheel "don't bundle" — the resulting wheels had extensions with `NEEDED libllama.so.0` but no `inferna_<backend>.libs/` contents, breaking `import inferna` with `ImportError: libllama.so.0: cannot open shared object file` on any host without llama.cpp installed system-wide. Repair excludes are now limited to true system/driver libs (`libcuda.so.1`, `libcudart.so.12`, `libcublas*.so.12`, `libamdhip64.so.6`, `libhipblas.so.2`, `librocblas.so.4`, `libhsa-runtime64.so.1`, `libsycl.so.8`, `libOpenCL.so.1`, `libvulkan.so.1`, `libgomp.so.1`), letting auditwheel auto-bundle the project libs via `RUNPATH` lookup as originally designed.

- **Recursive ccache invocation in GPU wheel builds** -- `CMakeLists.txt` set `RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE=ccache` unconditionally whenever ccache was found on `PATH`, while `build-gpu-wheels.yml` already sets `CMAKE_{C,CXX,CUDA,HIP}_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache` via `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT_LINUX`. The stacked wrappers produced `ccache ccache gcc …`, which ccache rejects with `Recursive invocation`, failing every CUDA/ROCm/SYCL/Vulkan job at the first compile step. CMake now skips its own wrapping when `CMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` or `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` is already defined.

## [0.2.11]

### Changed

- **stable-diffusion.cpp bumped to master-580-7d33d4b** -- Tracked additions to `stable-diffusion.h`: new `ER_SDE_SAMPLE_METHOD` sampler (exposed as `SampleMethod.ER_SDE`; CLI picks it up automatically), and capability-query APIs `sd_ctx_supports_image_generation` / `sd_ctx_supports_video_generation` (exposed as `SDContext.supports_image_generation` / `.supports_video_generation` properties so callers can branch on model capability rather than catching a failure -- standard SD/SDXL/FLUX vs WAN-style video models).

- **llama.cpp bumped to `b8833`** -- Upstream renamed the `common` CMake target (and its static archive `libcommon.a`) to `llama-common` / `libllama-common.a`. Updated `scripts/manage.py` (`LlamaCppBuilder.libs_static`, static and shared `cmake_build_targets` lists, and the `copy_lib` call) and `Makefile` (`LLAMACPP_LIBS` on macOS) accordingly.

- **Strict mypy across `src/`** -- `pyproject.toml` sets `strict = true`, excludes `src/inferna/_vendor/`. ~35 files touched: added signatures, narrowed `Optional` lazy attributes (`LLM._ctx` / `_sampler` / `_cache` returned from `_ensure_*`), tightened generics, cast Cython returns. Two latent bugs surfaced: `agents/acp.py` `ContentBlock.text` classmethod shadowed the `text` dataclass field (renamed to `from_text`; callers migrated); `llama/cli.py` `_generate_text` dropped its computed result instead of returning it (return added).

- **Strict mypy, lint, and format extended to `scripts/`** -- `make qa` is now clean across 62 source files.

- **`scripts/run_wheel_test.py` hardened for CI smoke-testing** -- Reworked so `test all all` now runs the full (sd × gen) × 3 matrix, accumulates `(kind, n, rc)` results, and prints a `PASS/FAIL` summary with final exit status = worst rc instead of aborting on the first failure. New flags: `--fail-fast` (restore old abort-first behaviour), `--timeout SECONDS` (subprocess timeout → 124 on expiry), `--dry-run` (print the matrix without downloading or invoking). HF downloads use `hf_hub_download(local_dir=..., local_dir_use_symlinks=False)` so files land in `MODELS_DIR` instead of doubling disk via a cache→copy. `_download_urllib` streams in 1 MiB chunks and prints progress every ~2s. New `list-models` / `list-tests` subcommands. Dedicated `ModelSourceUnavailable` exception replaces the `SystemExit`-catch trick. Per-backend env defaults only apply when the caller hasn't already set the variable (so user-set `GGML_VK_VISIBLE_DEVICES` wins).

- **Test imports switched to `SqliteVectorStore`** -- `tests/test_rag_store.py` and `tests/test_rag_dedup.py` imported `VectorStore` directly, triggering the new `DeprecationWarning` every run. Swapped to `SqliteVectorStore`; test class names left as-is (they don't instantiate the deprecated alias).

### Added

- **`AgentProtocol`** -- Structural contract (`run`, `stream`, `metrics`) in `src/inferna/agents/types.py`, inherited by `ReActAgent`, `ConstrainedAgent`, `ContractAgent`. The new `types.py` also holds the shared `AgentEvent` / `EventType` / `AgentMetrics` / `AgentResult` dataclasses (formerly in `react.py`), so `constrained.py` and `contract.py` no longer import from the ReActAgent module just to get the contract. Duplicate `AgentMetrics` in `constrained.py` (byte-identical) removed. Eliminates the `cast(Optional[AgentMetrics], ...)` and `-> Any` workarounds in `async_agent.py` and `acp.py`.

- **`EmbedderProtocol` and `RAG(embedder=...)`** -- Protocol (`dimension`, `embed`, `embed_batch`, `close`) in `src/inferna/rag/types.py` alongside the existing dataclasses and `VectorStoreProtocol`. Default llama.cpp `Embedder` inherits explicitly. `RAG.__init__` gains `embedder: EmbedderProtocol | None = None` symmetric to `store=`; passing one skips default construction. Combined with `VectorStoreProtocol`, makes the RAG layer pluggable (OpenAI + Qdrant, sentence-transformers + sqlite, etc.). Both packages use `types.py` as the shared-vocabulary module, consistent with `agents/types.py`.

- **`McpConnectionProtocol`** -- Protocol in `src/inferna/agents/mcp.py` replacing `McpConnection = Union[McpStdioConnection, McpHttpConnection]`. Both connection classes inherit explicitly; `McpConnection` kept as an alias. Lets the reserved `McpTransportType.SSE` transport drop in without touching Union literals. `McpHttpConnection.send_request` timeout widened to `Optional[float]` (None → 30s) to match the protocol; behaviour unchanged for existing callers.

- **`VectorStoreProtocol`, `SqliteVectorStore`, `RAG(store=...)`** -- Protocol (`search`, `add`, `is_source_indexed`, `get_source_by_label`, `clear`, `close`, `__len__`) in `src/inferna/rag/types.py`. Default sqlite backend renamed `VectorStore` → `SqliteVectorStore` in `src/inferna/rag/store.py` and inherits explicitly. `RAG.__init__` gains `store: VectorStoreProtocol | None = None` for Qdrant/Chroma/LanceDB/pgvector adapters without forking. Sqlite-specific features (quantization, FTS5 `HybridStore`, raw `store.conn`) stay on the concrete class. Backends without dedup may return False/None from `is_source_indexed`/`get_source_by_label` -- the pipeline degrades to always-re-index. Reference Qdrant adapter tracked as TODO.

- **MCP client api on `LLM`** -- `LLM.add_mcp_server(name, *, command/args/env/cwd | url/headers, ...)` (lazy-creates `McpClient`, infers transport, fail-fast connects), plus `remove_mcp_server`, `list_mcp_tools`, `list_mcp_resources`, `call_mcp_tool`, `read_mcp_resource`. `chat_with_tools(messages, ..., use_mcp=True)` drives a `ReActAgent` with caller tools + MCP tools merged (text-based ReAct loop works on any GGUF). `LLM.close()` disconnects best-effort. 15 mocked tests in `tests/test_api_mcp.py`. MCP-server direction deferred -- see `docs/dev/mcp.md`.

- **`docs/dev/mcp.md`** -- Two-direction MCP integration proposal (inferna-as-client, inferna-as-server via stdio + Streamable-HTTP on `EmbeddedServer`) with merits/counterweights and build order. Client direction recommended now; server deferred until a concrete `transcribe`/`generate_image` consumer appears.

- **`docs/mcp.md`** -- User-facing doc for the MCP client API on `LLM`: stdio/HTTP quick-start, full method reference (`add_mcp_server`, `remove_mcp_server`, `list_mcp_tools`, `list_mcp_resources`, `call_mcp_tool`, `read_mcp_resource`, `chat_with_tools`), direct-invocation example, and mixing local `Tool`s with MCP tools. Linked from `mkdocs.yml` under the Agents section. The server direction remains deferred and still lives only in the `docs/dev/mcp.md` design draft.

- **Pluggable-backend docs for RAG** -- New "Pluggable Backends" sections in `docs/rag_overview.md`, `docs/rag_embedder.md` (`EmbedderProtocol`), and `docs/rag_vectorstore.md` (`VectorStoreProtocol`). Each shows the protocol signature and a custom-backend example (OpenAI-embeddings / Qdrant-adapter sketches) so the `RAG(embedder=..., store=...)` pluggability is discoverable from the user guide rather than only from source. `rag_vectorstore.md` retitled to `SqliteVectorStore` with a prominent deprecation note for the old `VectorStore` alias; `mkdocs.yml` nav relabeled to match.

- **Doc sync for the 0.2.10 → Unreleased delta** -- Updated stale references throughout: `README.md` version line (0.2.8 → 0.2.10, llama.cpp b8757 → b8833); `docs/api_reference.md` llama.cpp b8429 → b8833; `docs/stable_diffusion.md` `SampleMethod` enum table gained `ER_SDE` + `COUNT` rows, and `SDContext` methods table gained `supports_image_generation` / `supports_video_generation`; `docs/cli-cheatsheet.md` `--sampler` choice list gained `er_sde`.

- **Vendor-drift guard (`check-vendor.yml` + `manage.py check_vendor`)** -- new `scripts/manage.py check_vendor` subcommand clones llama.cpp at the pinned `LLAMACPP_VERSION` into a tempdir, re-runs the `glob_copy` header-extraction logic used by `LlamaCppBuilder.download_release` / `build_static` / `build_shared`, and `diff -r -q`'s the result against `thirdparty/llama.cpp/include/`. Non-zero exit on any mismatch. Wrapped in `.github/workflows/check-vendor.yml` (path-filtered to `scripts/manage.py`, `thirdparty/llama.cpp/include/**`, and the workflow itself; triggers on PR + push to main/dev). A second step uses `git status --porcelain` to fail on untracked files under the vendored tree so new upstream files don't slip in unnoticed (which would have caught the recent untracked `build-info.h` on the `b8833` bump). Catches the class of silent-drift bug that preceded the `GGML_MAX_NAME=128` incident and enforces the invariant `build_config.llama_cpp_version` ↔ `thirdparty/llama.cpp/include/`

- **`scripts/run_wheel_test.py` self-contained wheel smoke-tester** -- Single-file Python runner for validating built inferna wheels across all backends (`cpu`, `cuda`, `vulkan`, `rocm`, `sycl`). Detects the installed backend via `importlib.metadata`, can `pip install` any backend wheel, downloads required models from the Hugging Face Hub (overridable via `INFERNA_MODEL_<KEY>` env vars and `INFERNA_MODELS_DIR`), and runs stable-diffusion (`txt2img`) and text-generation tests as inline Python functions, providing a reproducible single-file harness that can be dropped into any environment with a built wheel

### Deprecated

- **`VectorStore` → use `SqliteVectorStore`.** The legacy name still resolves but emits `DeprecationWarning` via PEP 562 module `__getattr__` in both `inferna.rag` and `inferna.rag.store` -- fires once per import site (not on every `import inferna.rag`) with `stacklevel=2` aimed at the user's import line. Removal tied to the Qdrant-adapter TODO so the rename and multi-backend story land together.

## [0.2.10]

### Changed

- **GPU wheel size reduced ~50%** -- The stable-diffusion extension no longer statically embeds the ggml GPU backend (e.g. `libggml-cuda.a`). It now links against llama.cpp's shared ggml dylibs, the same copies already bundled for the llama/whisper bindings. Two ABI issues were resolved to make this work: (1) `_sync_ggml_abi()` overlays llama.cpp's ggml source onto stable-diffusion.cpp before compilation, eliminating enum-ordinal drift; (2) `GGML_MAX_NAME=128` is propagated to the llama.cpp shared lib build to match stable-diffusion.cpp's requirement, preventing `ggml_tensor` struct layout divergence that caused `ggml_are_same_layout` assertion crashes with FLUX-like models under CPU offloading. The 0.2.9 workaround (`SD_USE_VENDORED_GGML=ON` default) is reversed for all dynamic GPU targets. The old static-link behavior remains available via `SD_USE_VENDORED_GGML=1`

- **Local CUDA builds default to native GPU architecture** -- The `build-cuda-dynamic` and `wheel-cuda-dynamic` Makefile targets now default `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` to `native`, building only for the installed GPU. This reduces `libggml-cuda.so` from ~500 MB (7 architectures) to ~137 MB (1 architecture) for local development. CI continues to target `sm_75` explicitly

### Fixed

- **`build_config.json` missing from wheels** -- scikit-build-core's `wheel.packages` collector filters files through `.gitignore`, and `src/inferna/build_config.json` is listed there (it's generated at build time). As a result the JSON was silently dropped from every wheel, leaving `inferna info` reporting `unknown` versions and `CPU only` for built backends even on GPU-enabled builds. Fixed by adding a CMake `install(FILES ... OPTIONAL)` directive so the file is installed via the CMake stage, which bypasses the gitignore filter

- **auditwheel no longer SONAME-rewrites bundled project libs** -- All GPU CI workflows now exclude bundled project libraries (`libllama`, `libggml-*`, `libmtmd`, `libgomp`) from `auditwheel repair`, preventing the SONAME rewriting that caused the double-free crash documented in `docs/dev/cuda-double-free.md`. Each backend also excludes its backend-specific ggml lib (`libggml-cuda.so`, `libggml-hip.so`, etc.) from repair. This doesn't mean that the they are not included in the package, they are still included in the inferna/llama directory rather than the auditwheel `.lib` directory for repaired (i.e. modified) dynamic libraries.

- **Vulkan dynamic wheels crashed with `ggml_are_same_layout` on stable-diffusion image generation** -- Unlike CUDA/ROCm/SYCL, llama.cpp ships a pre-built Vulkan release tarball. `manage.py build --dynamic` downloaded that tarball instead of building from source, which meant the `GGML_MAX_NAME=128` define needed for SD's `ggml_tensor` layout (propagated via `CMAKE_C_FLAGS` in `LlamaCppBuilder.build_shared()`) never reached the bundled `libggml-*.so` files. The resulting ABI mismatch with stable-diffusion.cpp's `libstable-diffusion.a` (compiled with 128) caused SD's `ggml_set_name()` writes to spill past the shorter `name[64]` field into `extra`/`padding`, corrupting subsequent tensor operations. Fixed in `scripts/manage.py` by taking the `build_shared()` path whenever `SD_USE_VENDORED_GGML=0`, regardless of whether an upstream pre-built release is available. See `docs/dev/ggml_max_name.md`

- **`CMakeLists.txt` evaluated `SD_USE_VENDORED_GGML` before reading the env var** -- The `if(NOT SD_USE_VENDORED_GGML) add_definitions(-DGGML_MAX_NAME=128) endif()` block sat above the env-var handler that actually updates the variable, so the define never fired when `SD_USE_VENDORED_GGML=0` was supplied via environment (the CI and Makefile-dynamic path). Moved the block below the env-var handlers so the check sees the resolved value. Didn't cause a runtime crash today (the Cython wrappers don't dereference `ggml_tensor` fields) but would have silently misbehaved as soon as any CMake-compiled inferna code touched the struct

- **`build_config.json` shipped with empty `versions` in CI wheels** -- CI runs `manage.py write_build_config` after the build, overwriting the good config produced by `build --all`. `do_write_build_config` passed an empty `builder_versions` dict, so the loops that populate `versions` (and read ggml versions from the build tree) never ran, leaving `inferna info` to report `version: unknown` for llama/whisper/sd. Fixed by including the builder-version constants.

- **Linux Vulkan dynamic wheel build failed with `spirv/unified1/spirv.hpp: No such file or directory`** -- A side-effect of the fix above: forcing llama.cpp to compile from source for Vulkan dynamic builds (so `GGML_MAX_NAME=128` propagates) exposed that llama.cpp's vulkan backend `#include`s `<spirv/unified1/spirv.hpp>`, which is provided by SPIRV-Headers, not by the `vulkan-headers` / `vulkan-loader-devel` packages installed in `CIBW_BEFORE_ALL_LINUX`. Fixed in `.github/workflows/build-gpu-wheels.yml` by installing SPIRV-Headers from the deps that `shaderc`'s `git-sync-deps` already clones into `/tmp/shaderc/third_party/spirv-headers/` (one extra `cmake --install` step before the directory is deleted, no additional download). One-shot side effect: bumping the workflow file invalidates the `deps-{cuda,rocm,sycl,vulkan}-*` caches for the next run, so all four GPU jobs re-bootstrap thirdparty deps once before the cache re-warms

## [0.2.9]

### Changed

- **stable-diffusion.cpp now uses its own vendored ggml by default** - The SD extension statically links stable-diffusion.cpp's own vendored ggml instead of sharing llama.cpp's ggml dylibs. Fixes a `ggml_backend_tensor_copy` assertion crash ("cannot copy tensors with different layouts") during CUDA image generation caused by subtle ggml version incompatibilities between llama.cpp and stable-diffusion.cpp. The old behavior (shared ggml) can be restored with `--sd-shared-ggml` or `SD_USE_VENDORED_GGML=0`, but is not recommended for GPU backends. The previous `--sd-vendored-ggml` flag is removed since vendored is now the default

- **Updated llama.cpp from b8757 to b8802** - Updated bundled llama.cpp. Adapted Cython bindings to the `mtmd_decode_use_non_causal` signature change (now takes a second `chunk` parameter; passing `NULL` preserves the previous default behavior per upstream docs)

- **Updated stable-diffusion.cpp from master-559-dd75372 to master-567-ee5bf95** - Updated bundled stable-diffusion.cpp (no API-breaking changes)

- **Reorganized internal package structure** - Cleaned up the six `_<name>.py` files at the package root. `_defaults.py` renamed to `defaults.py` (public, re-exported from `__init__`). `_validation.py` moved to `utils/validation.py`. `_readline.py` and `_backend_dl.py` moved to `_internal/`. `_backend.py` and `_build_info.py` combined into a single `build_config.json` at the package root with a cached loader at `_internal/build_config.py` providing `get()`, `backend()`, `backend_enabled()`, `versions()`, and `dump()` accessors. The JSON uses nested backend structure (`backend.cuda.enabled`, `backend.cuda.architectures`, etc.) instead of flat prefixed keys. Generated by `manage.py`, `.gitignore`d, included in wheels. `manage.py` updated to produce the JSON via `_write_build_config()`

### Added

- **Multimodal (mtmd) integration tests** - Added 5 integration tests in `TestMtmdIntegration` that exercise the native mtmd Cython bindings end-to-end against a real gemma-4 model: context creation with capability checks, single/multi-image tokenization, text token readback, and marker/bitmap mismatch error handling. Tests auto-skip when model files are not present

- **`--stats` flag for `generate` and `chat` CLI modes** - When set, displays a formatted table of session statistics on exit: prompt tokens, generated tokens, prompt eval time, generation time, total time, and tokens/second. In single-turn modes, stats come from the high-level API's `GenerationStats`. In interactive chat, stats are accumulated across all turns and printed when the session ends (Ctrl-C, EOT, or empty input). Default: off

- **`LlamaContext.get_perf_data()` and `LlamaSampler.get_perf_data()`** - Exposed the previously commented-out C-level performance data as Python dicts. Context returns `t_start_ms`, `t_load_ms`, `t_p_eval_ms`, `t_eval_ms`, `n_p_eval`, `n_eval`, `n_reused`. Sampler returns `t_sample_ms`, `n_sample`. More accurate than wall-clock timing for profiling prompt eval and generation phases

- **`MtmdContextParams.warmup` property** - Exposed the `warmup` field (getter/setter and `__init__` parameter, default `True`). When `False`, skips the warmup encode pass during context creation, reducing initialization latency for callers that don't need it

- **`mtmd_decoder_pos` struct and `mtmd_image_tokens_get_decoder_pos()` in `.pxd`** - Declared the new M-RoPE decoder position API (`mtmd_decoder_pos` with `t`, `x`, `y` fields, `mtmd_image_tokens_get_decoder_pos()`, and `mtmd_helper_image_get_decoder_pos()`) replacing the deprecated `mtmd_image_tokens_get_nx/ny` functions removed upstream in b8802

### Fixed

- **`--stats` silently skipped in streaming mode** - `inferna generate --stream --stats` and `inferna chat --stream --stats` now print the stats table. The streaming path previously set `response = None` and the stats guard `response is not None` always failed. Streaming CLI commands now use `LLM` directly to access `_last_stream_stats` populated at the end of the stream, providing accurate prompt/generated token counts and wall-clock timing

- **CUDA image generation crashed with `ggml_are_same_layout` assertion** - `inferna.sd txt2img` with CUDA crashed during `generate_image()` because the SD extension linked against llama.cpp's shared ggml dylibs, which have subtle incompatibilities with stable-diffusion.cpp's ggml usage (tensor layout assumptions in `ggml_backend_tensor_copy`). Fixed by defaulting `SD_USE_VENDORED_GGML=ON` so SD statically links its own vendored ggml copy

- **Single-turn `chat()` crashed on Gemma 4 with `Failed to apply chat template`** - The standalone `apply_chat_template()` function in `api.py` (used by `chat()` and `inferna chat -p`) went straight to the C `llama_chat_apply_template` API without trying the vendored jinja2 interpreter first. Gemma 4's template uses Jinja syntax that the C substring heuristic doesn't recognise. Added the same two-tier fallback (jinja2 first, C API on failure) that `LLM._apply_template` and interactive `Chat._apply_template` already had

### Removed

- **Deprecated `mtmd_image_tokens_get_nx/ny` declarations** - Removed from `mtmd.pxd`. These were wrapped in `DEPRECATED()` upstream in b8802 and will be removed. Use `mtmd_image_tokens_get_decoder_pos()` instead

## [0.2.8]

### Added

- **New `LlamaContextParams` properties** - Exposed `flash_attn_type` (replaces the previously commented-out `flash_attn` boolean with the new int-based enum: -1=auto, 0=disabled, 1=enabled), `embeddings` (extract embeddings together with logits), `op_offload` (offload host tensor operations to device), `swa_full` (full-size SWA cache for improved perf when `n_seq_max > 1`), and `kv_unified` (unified buffer across input sequences for attention)

- **Expanded `WhisperFullParams` bindings** - Exposed ~30 previously inaccessible parameters: timestamp thresholds (`thold_pt`, `thold_ptsum`), segment control (`max_len`, `split_on_word`, `max_tokens`), debug/speed-up (`debug_mode`, `audio_ctx`, `tdrz_enable`), prompt/regex (`suppress_regex`, `initial_prompt`, `carry_initial_prompt`), language detection (`detect_language`), decoding/suppression (`suppress_blank`, `suppress_nst`, `max_initial_ts`, `length_penalty`), temperature fallback (`temperature_inc`, `entropy_thold`, `logprob_thold`, `no_speech_thold`), strategy params (`greedy_best_of`, `beam_size`, `beam_patience` via inline C accessors for anonymous-struct fields), grammar (`grammar_penalty`), and VAD (`vad`, `vad_model_path`). String parameters (`initial_prompt`, `suppress_regex`, `vad_model_path`) use the established bytes-ref-pinning pattern to keep C pointers valid

- **Expanded `SDSampleParams` bindings** - Added `slg_layers` (skip-layer guidance layer indices with owned int buffer) and `custom_sigmas` (custom noise schedule sigma values with owned float buffer). Both manage heap-allocated arrays with proper `__dealloc__` cleanup

- **Expanded `SDImageGenParams` bindings** - Added LoRA support (`set_loras()` accepting list of dicts with path/multiplier/is_high_noise), reference images for IP-Adapter (`set_ref_images()`), Photo Maker parameters (`set_pm_id_images()`, `pm_id_embed_path`, `pm_style_strength`), VAE tiling (`vae_tile_rel_size`), and full step-cache parameter surface (`cache_error_decay_rate`, `cache_use_relative_threshold`, `cache_reset_error_on_compute`, `cache_fn_compute_blocks`, `cache_bn_compute_blocks`, `cache_residual_diff_threshold`, `cache_max_warmup_steps`, `cache_max_cached_steps`, `cache_max_continuous_cached_steps`, `cache_taylorseer_n_derivatives`, `cache_taylorseer_skip_interval`, `cache_scm_mask`, `cache_scm_policy_dynamic`, `cache_spectrum_w`, `cache_spectrum_m`, `cache_spectrum_lam`, `cache_spectrum_window_size`, `cache_spectrum_flex_window`, `cache_spectrum_warmup_steps`, `cache_spectrum_stop_percent`). All heap-allocated buffers (`_ref_images_buf`, `_loras_buf`, `_pm_id_images_buf`) are freed in `__dealloc__`

- **Spectrum cache fields in `stable_diffusion.pxd`** - Declared `spectrum_w`, `spectrum_m`, `spectrum_lam`, `spectrum_window_size`, `spectrum_flex_window`, `spectrum_warmup_steps`, and `spectrum_stop_percent` in the `sd_sample_params_t` extern struct

- **`SDContext.generate_video()` new parameters** - Added `eta` (default `inf`, auto-resolve per sample method), `moe_boundary` (Mixture of Experts boundary, default 0.875), and `vace_strength` (VACE strength, default 1.0) to the video generation API

- **`whisper_cpp.disable_logging()`** - New module-level function that suppresses all C-level log output from whisper.cpp and ggml by installing a no-op `ggml_log_callback` via `whisper_log_set`. The `whisper.pxd` now declares the proper `ggml_log_callback` typedef and `ggml_log_level` enum so `whisper_log_set` uses the correct function pointer type instead of `void *`

- **`inferna transcribe -v/--verbose` flag** - The whisper CLI now suppresses C-level log spam (ggml device init, model loading, backend allocation, Metal diagnostics) by default. Pass `-v`/`--verbose` to restore the full native output for debugging

- **Interactive chat streaming** - `inferna chat` interactive mode now streams tokens as they are generated (matching `inferna rag` behavior). Pass `--no-stream` to buffer the full response before printing. The `Chat` class gains an `on_token` callback parameter on `generate()` and a `stream` parameter on `chat_loop()`

- **Interactive chat sampling parameters** - `inferna chat` interactive mode now honors `--temperature`, `--top-k`, `--top-p`, `--min-p`, `--repeat-penalty`, and `--seed`. Previously these flags were silently dropped when entering interactive mode; the `Chat` class hardcoded `min_p=0.05`, `temp=0.8`, `seed=1337`. The `Chat.__init__` constructor now accepts all six parameters and wires them into the sampler chain (penalties, top_k, top_p, min_p, temp, dist) in the correct order

### Fixed

- **Interactive chat crashed on Gemma 4 with `Failed to apply chat template`** - The `Chat` class in `llama/chat.py` called `llama_chat_apply_template` (C API) directly, which uses a hardcoded substring heuristic that doesn't recognise Gemma 4's `<|turn>` template format. Added a two-tier template path mirroring `api.py`: try the vendored jinja2 interpreter first (handles Gemma 4, Qwen3, and any template the C heuristic doesn't cover), then fall back to the C API

- **Interactive chat truncated Qwen3 responses after reasoning blocks** - The `generate()` method had a heuristic that stopped generation after 3 consecutive whitespace tokens. The blank line between `</think>` and the actual answer triggered this, cutting off the response. Removed the broken heuristic

- **Interactive chat used raw ANSI escape codes instead of color utilities** - Replaced inline `\033[...m` sequences in `llama/chat.py` with `green()`, `yellow()`, and `END` from the existing `inferna.utils.color` module

- **CUDA wheel double-free on interpreter shutdown** - Dynamic-linked CUDA wheels (`WITH_DYLIB=1`) crashed with `double free or corruption (!prev)` during Python exit. The root cause was `auditwheel repair` using `patchelf` to rewrite ELF SONAME headers on bundled GPU runtime libraries, which altered glibc's `dlclose` unload ordering and caused CUDA's internal `atexit` handlers to fire after the memory they referenced had already been unmapped. Fixed by adding `--exclude` flags for GPU runtime system libraries (`libcuda.so.1`, `libcudart.so.12`, `libcublas.so.12`, `libcublasLt.so.12`) and `libgomp.so.1` (GCC OpenMP runtime) so auditwheel leaves them as system dependencies rather than bundling and SONAME-rewriting them. The same `libgomp.so.1` exclude was applied to all GPU wheel variants (ROCm, SYCL, Vulkan). See `docs/dev/cuda-double-free.md` for full analysis

- **`test_whisper_timing_functions` called `ctx.n_vocab` without parentheses** - The test compared a bound method object against `int` instead of calling it, causing a `TypeError`. Fixed to `ctx.n_vocab()`

- **`inferna <delegation-command> --help` showed no options** - The six delegation subcommands (`transcribe`, `server`, `tts`, `sd`, `agent`, `memory`) were registered with `add_help=True` (argparse default), so `--help` was intercepted by the top-level subparser and never reached the delegate's own parser. Fixed by adding `add_help=False` to all delegation subparsers

- **Interactive chat left terminal colored after Ctrl-C** - If Ctrl-C was pressed during streaming generation, the yellow ANSI foreground escape was never reset, leaving the shell prompt colored. The chat loop is now wrapped in `try/finally` with an unconditional `END` reset

- **CLI help strings missing on sampling flags** - `--max-tokens`, `--temperature`, `--top-k`, `--top-p`, `--min-p`, `--repeat-penalty`, `-ngl`, `-c`, `--seed`, and `--verbose` had no `help=` text in the `generate`, `chat`, `embed`, and `rag` argument parsers. All now include descriptions with default values via `%(default)s`

### Changed

- **Centralized default constants in `inferna._defaults`** - All generation-related magic numbers (temperature, top_k, top_p, min_p, repeat_penalty, max_tokens, n_gpu_layers, n_batch, seed, etc.) now live in a single `_defaults.py` module. `api.py`, `__main__.py`, `batching.py`, `agents/react.py`, `llama/chat.py`, `llama/tts.py`, `rag/pipeline.py`, and the `langchain`/`openai_compat` integrations all import from it. Constants are re-exported from `inferna.__init__` for library consumers

- **Aligned defaults with llama.cpp C library** - `repeat_penalty` changed from 1.1 to 1.0 (disabled, matching C default), `n_gpu_layers` from 99 to -1 (canonical sentinel for "offload all"), `n_batch` from 512 to 2048 (C default), `seed` from -1 to 0xFFFFFFFF (C sentinel, lets the library handle randomization internally instead of low-entropy `time.time()` seeds). `n_gpu_layers` validation now accepts -1

## [0.2.7]

### Fixed

- **Blank white image from `inferna.sd` txt2img on CUDA backend** - `SDContextParams` defaulted `wtype` to `SDType.F16`, forcing dequantization of all model weights to F16 at load time. The C library defaults to `SD_TYPE_COUNT` (auto-detect), which preserves the model's native quantization. For quantized models like `z_image_turbo-Q6_K.gguf`, the forced F16 override combined with `--offload-to-cpu` on CUDA produced blank white output. Added `SDType.COUNT` to the enum and changed the default to match the C library. Metal was unaffected because its hardware is F16-native

- **`sample_method` and `scheduler` defaulted to hardcoded values instead of auto-detect** - `SDSampleParams`, `SDImageGenParams`, `SDContext.generate()`, `generate_video()`, `text_to_image()`, `text_to_images()`, and `image_to_image()` all defaulted `sample_method` to `EULER_A` and `scheduler` to `DISCRETE`. The C library defaults to `SAMPLE_METHOD_COUNT` / `SCHEDULER_COUNT`, which are sentinel values that auto-resolve to the model's preferred method at generation time. Added `SampleMethod.COUNT`, `Scheduler.COUNT`, and `Prediction.COUNT` to the enums and changed all defaults to match the C library

- **`eta` parameter defaulted to 0.0 instead of auto-resolve** - `SDSampleParams`, `SDContext.generate()`, `text_to_image()`, `text_to_images()`, and the `--eta` CLI flag all defaulted eta to `0.0`. The C library defaults to `INFINITY`, which is a sentinel that auto-resolves to the appropriate value per sample method (e.g. 1.0 for EULER_A, 0.0 for EULER). Changed all defaults to `float('inf')` to match

- **`Prediction.SD3_FLOW` and `Prediction.DEFAULT` referenced in CLI but not defined** - The `--prediction` CLI handler referenced non-existent enum members. Fixed to use `Prediction.FLOW` and `Prediction.EPS` respectively

- **Stale defaults in SD documentation** - Updated `docs/stable_diffusion.md`, `docs/api_reference.md`, and `docs/cli-cheatsheet.md` to reflect the corrected defaults: `wtype` (`COUNT` not `F16`), `eta` (`inf` not `0.0`), `sample_method`/`scheduler` (`COUNT` not `EULER_A`/`DISCRETE`), and `--prediction` choices (`flow` not `sd3_flow`)

## [0.2.6]

### Fixed

- **`pytest-review` erroneously included as a runtime dependency in 0.2.5** - `pytest-review>=0.1.2` was accidentally added to `[project] dependencies` (and duplicated in `[dependency-groups] dev`), causing `pip install inferna` to pull in a test-only package and its transitive dependencies. Removed from both sections; `dependencies` is now empty again as intended

## [0.2.5]

### Added

- **Typed exceptions for model loaders** - `LLM`, `LlamaModel`, `LlamaContext`, `WhisperContext`, and `SDContext` now raise `FileNotFoundError`, `IsADirectoryError`, `PermissionError`, or `ValueError` for the common bad-input cases (missing path, directory, empty file, wrong magic, truncated header, OOM `n_ctx`) instead of opaque NULL pointers, raw C++ assertions, or segfaults. Shared validation logic in new `inferna._validation` module. 30 regression tests in `tests/test_error_messages.py`. Resolves the "Error message audit" item in `TODO.md`

- **Memory-leak regression tests** - 3 new tests in `tests/test_memory_leaks.py` covering loop create/destroy of `LLM`, `SDContext`, and `WhisperContext`. Use `ru_maxrss` (no psutil dep), per-loader RSS tolerance windows, marked `slow`, POSIX-only

- **RAG repetition loop guard** - Two opt-in mechanisms in `RAGPipeline` to fix the Qwen3-4B paragraph-loop bug:
  - `NGramRepetitionDetector` (`inferna.rag.repetition`) — streaming word-level n-gram detector with rolling window. Off by default at the library level; on by default in `inferna rag` CLI
  - `RAGConfig.use_chat_template` — routes through `LLM.chat()` with system+user messages instead of raw `Question:/Answer:` prompting, sidestepping the loop at the source
  - End-to-end verified against `Qwen3-4B-Q8_0.gguf`. Pinned by `tests/test_rag_repetition.py` (14 unit tests), `tests/test_rag_pipeline.py` (14 mock tests), and `tests/test_rag_integration.py::TestQwen3RAGLoopRegression` (real-model regression class)

- **`<think>...</think>` reasoning-block stripping for RAG** - New `ThinkBlockStripper` class (`inferna.rag.repetition`) is a stream-safe state machine that removes chain-of-thought blocks from Qwen3 / DeepSeek-R1 / similar reasoning-tuned models. Handles tags split across chunk boundaries, multiple blocks per stream, unclosed blocks, and leading-whitespace stripping after each close tag. Wired into `RAGPipeline._generate_chunks` as the outermost filter (runs before the n-gram detector so the detector's window isn't polluted with reasoning). Configurable via `RAGConfig.strip_think_blocks` (off by default at library level, on by default in CLI with `--show-think` opt-out). 22 new tests across `tests/test_rag_repetition.py` and `tests/test_rag_pipeline.py`

- **Vendored jinja2 chat-template renderer** - Pure-Python copies of `jinja2 3.1.6` and `markupsafe 3.0.3` (no `_speedups.c`) under `src/inferna/_vendor/`, ~616 KB total. New `LLM._apply_jinja_template` evaluates the model's embedded Jinja template directly, handling any GGUF whose template doesn't match llama.cpp's hardcoded substring heuristics (Gemma 4 was the canonical bug). Two import-path rewrites are applied to make the vendored copy hermetic; both are scripted in `scripts/vendor_jinja2.sh`. Same `ImmutableSandboxedEnvironment` setup HuggingFace's `apply_chat_template` uses. See `docs/dev/chat_templates.md` for the full design and `src/inferna/_vendor/README.md` for vendoring policy. 15 tests in `tests/test_jinja_chat.py`

- **Readline support in interactive REPLs** - `inferna rag` and `inferna chat` now have up/down history cycling, line editing, Ctrl-R reverse search, and persistent per-command history files (`~/.inferna_rag_history`, `~/.inferna_chat_history`). Implementation is a small wrapper around the stdlib `readline` module (`inferna._readline`); gracefully no-ops on Windows without `pyreadline3`. 13 tests in `tests/test_readline.py`

- **Persistent vector store via `inferna rag --db PATH`** - Two new CLI flags expose `VectorStore`'s file-backed mode that the library has always supported but the CLI never wired up. `--db PATH` writes the index to a SQLite file and reopens it on subsequent runs (corpus is embedded only once). `--rebuild` deletes and recreates an existing DB (use after switching embedding models or chunking config). Decision matrix: `--db PATH` + `-f/-d` creates or appends; `--db PATH` alone reuses an existing DB without re-indexing; `--db PATH --rebuild -f` deletes and recreates. Without `--db`, the existing in-memory default is preserved. 9 new tests in `tests/test_main.py::TestCmdRag` covering each branch of the decision matrix and friendly-error propagation

- **Vector store metadata-compatibility schema** - `VectorStore` records embedding model fingerprint, chunk size/overlap, inferna version, and created-at timestamp in the `{table_name}_meta` table. On reopen, mismatches with the caller's config raise `VectorStoreError` naming the stored vs. attempted value and pointing at `--rebuild`. Hard mismatches (dimension/metric/vector_type) always fire; soft mismatches (model fingerprint, chunk config) only fire when the caller opts in by passing the corresponding kwarg. `RAG.__init__` forwards these automatically. 11 new tests in `tests/test_rag_store.py::TestVectorStoreMetadataCompatibility`

- **Corpus deduplication via content hashing** - New `{table_name}_sources` table tracks `(content_hash, source_label, chunk_count, indexed_at)` for every source ever added; chunks and source row are written in a single transaction so crashes can't orphan chunks. `RAG.add_documents` and `add_texts` md5-hash inputs before indexing and silently skip already-indexed sources, returning an `IndexResult` (subclass of `list[int]` for back-compat) that exposes `.skipped_labels`. Same-name-different-content collisions raise `ValueError` pointing at `--rebuild` or rename. `inferna rag` surfaces skip counts in its status line, and re-running with the same `-f` is now a true no-op. 21 new tests in `tests/test_rag_dedup.py` and 9 in `tests/test_rag_store.py::TestVectorStoreSourceDedup`

- **`docs/dev/chat_templates.md`** - Maintainer guide to inferna's chat-template system: user-facing API, four-path layered architecture (vendored jinja2 → legacy substring heuristic → pipeline system-merge → pipeline raw-completion fallback), the vendored `_vendor` setup with both import-path rewrites explained, re-vendoring procedure, extension points, debugging recipes, and a file-and-line reference table. Preserves the original six-option design analysis (A-F) as a "Historical context" appendix

- **`docs/dev/runtime-guard.md`** - Maintainer guide to the concurrent-use guard on `LLM`/`WhisperContext`/`SDContext`: the underlying hazard, the implementation (busy-lock + `_try_acquire_busy()` + streaming wrapper), Cython layout notes (`cdef readonly object _busy_lock`), the test pattern, an "extending the guard" checklist for new native-touching methods, and a design-analysis section that walks through the five alternative designs considered (strict thread-id matching, blocking lock, per-thread context pool, docs-only, fix-upstream) with the pros, cons, and reason each was rejected. Includes the known weaknesses of the current design, the conditions under which we'd revisit "raise vs serialize", and three citable upstream references ([ggml-org/llama.cpp#499](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/499), [#3960](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/3960), [PR #6170](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/6170)) that establish the upstream contract: "always use one context per thread; do not share the same context across threads"

- **`docs/threading.md`** - User-facing companion to `runtime-guard.md`. Pattern catalogue and copy-pasteable examples for writing multi-threaded or async code with inferna: a "what's safe to share" table covering `LLM`, `Embedder`, `WhisperContext`, `SDContext`, `AsyncLLM`, `VectorStore`, `GenerationConfig`, `RAGConfig`, and `LlamaModel`; the three most common misuse patterns (module-global LLM, ThreadPoolExecutor with one shared LLM, streaming + non-streaming concurrent calls) with the corresponding fixes; four working patterns (`threading.local()` per worker, `AsyncLLM` for async servers, `asyncio.to_thread` for sync-LLM-from-async, `multiprocessing.Pool` for process-level parallelism); a `VectorStore`-specific section because its rejection comes from stdlib `sqlite3` rather than inferna itself; an "Open gaps" section documenting that `Embedder` does not yet have the runtime guard despite holding a `LlamaContext`; and per-backend caveats from the upstream maintainers (CPU/Metal/CUDA thread-safe across separate contexts, Vulkan/SYCL/HIP/OpenCL "probably not")

- **Concurrent-use guard on `LLM`, `Embedder`, `WhisperContext`, and `SDContext`** - Each instance now holds a `threading.Lock` acquired non-blockingly around every native-touching public method (`LLM.__call__`/`chat`/`generate_with_stats`/`reset_context`, `Embedder.embed`/`embed_with_info`, `WhisperContext.encode`/`full`, `SDContext.generate_with_params`/`generate_video`). A second thread that tries to call into the same instance while a call is in flight gets a clear `RuntimeError` instead of silently corrupting KV cache, sampler, or batch state inside llama.cpp / whisper.cpp / stable-diffusion.cpp. Sequential ownership transfer between threads (`asyncio.to_thread`, `ThreadPoolExecutor.submit`) is deliberately allowed because it is safe — the guard catches actual contention, not thread identity. `close()` / `__dealloc__` are intentionally unguarded so gc can run them on any thread. For streaming `LLM` calls, the lock is held until the generator is exhausted, closed, or garbage-collected. On `WhisperContext` and `SDContext` the lock is exposed as `cdef readonly object _busy_lock` so the regression tests can simulate contention without needing to pause inside a native call. 17 regression tests, all passing end-to-end with the standard project model fixtures: `tests/test_comprehensive.py::TestLLMConcurrencyGuard` (5, gated on `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf`), `tests/test_rag_embedder.py::TestEmbedderConcurrencyGuard` (6, gated on `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf`), `tests/test_sd.py::TestSDContextConcurrencyGuard` (3, gated on `sd_xl_turbo_1.0.q8_0.gguf`), `tests/test_whisper.py::TestWhisperContextConcurrencyGuard` (3, gated on `ggml-base.en.bin`)

- **`save_history()` public helper in `inferna._readline`** - Companion to `setup_history()` that callers can use to flush readline history mid-session. The atexit handler installed by `setup_history` now routes through it, so production save and test save share the same code path. Transparently applies the libedit magic-header workaround (see `Fixed` below)

- **`docs/dev/test-cleanup.md` and `sd_ctx_factory` pytest fixture** - Maintainer guide to the forced-cleanup pattern (`del ctx; gc.collect()`) required for tests that instantiate `SDContext`/`LLM`/`WhisperContext` on macOS Metal, with the 5-cycle reproducer and rejected alternatives. Companion short note added to `CLAUDE.md`. New `sd_ctx_factory` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` centralizes the cleanup; existing 5 tests keep inline cleanup with migration tracked in `TODO.md`

### Changed

- **Upgraded llama.cpp from b8705 to b8757** - Mirrored two upstream enum additions in the Cython bindings: `LLAMA_SPLIT_MODE_TENSOR = 3` added to `llama_split_mode` in `src/inferna/llama/llama.pxd`, and `GGML_BACKEND_DEVICE_TYPE_META` ("meta device wrapping multiple other devices for tensor parallelism") added to `ggml_backend_dev_type` in `src/inferna/llama/ggml.pxd`. The `device_info()` helper in `llama_cpp.pyx` learned the new `META` type-name mapping. Other upstream header changes in this range (new `_2d` async tensor copy variants and `const` qualifiers in `ggml-backend.h`, `PROJECTOR_TYPE_DOTS_OCR` in `clip-impl.h`, the `common_download_*` refactor in `download.h`, `ggml_backend_cuda_allreduce_tensor` in `ggml-cuda.h`) touch symbols inferna does not bind, so no further sync was required

- **Upgraded stable-diffusion.cpp from master-558-8afbeb6 to master-559-dd75372** - No `stable_diffusion.pxd` changes required for this bump: SD-specific public headers are unchanged in the upstream range. The only header diffs that landed under `thirdparty/stable-diffusion.cpp/include/` are in `ggml-backend.h` and `ggml-cuda.h`, and they are byte-for-byte identical to the llama.cpp ggml header diffs in the entry above — they appear under SD's include directory because `_sync_ggml_abi()` (`scripts/manage.py:1601-1628`) replaces SD's vendored ggml with llama.cpp's ggml at build time to keep enum-id ABI in sync between the two libraries linking against the same ggml dylib. None of the new symbols (`ggml_backend_tensor_set_2d` family, `GGML_BACKEND_DEVICE_TYPE_META`, `ggml_backend_cuda_allreduce_tensor`) are bound in `src/inferna/sd/`

- **`LlamaModel.__init__` exception types** - Bad model paths now raise `FileNotFoundError`, `IsADirectoryError`, `PermissionError`, or `ValueError` (truncated/wrong-magic/wrong-version GGUF). Post-load NULL check still raises `ValueError("Failed to load model from file: ...")` (substring preserved) but with a richer message listing likely causes

- **`LlamaContext.__init__` NULL handling** - Now raises `RuntimeError` with model path, requested `n_ctx`, model `n_ctx_train`, and OOM/n_batch hints (was a generic `ValueError`)

- **`WhisperContext.__init__` and `SDContext.__init__` validation** - Both now validate every configured model path (and sub-model paths for SD: VAE, CLIP-L/G, T5-XXL, ControlNet, TAESD, PhotoMaker, diffusion model) up front. Existing tests updated from `RuntimeError` to `FileNotFoundError`

- **`inferna rag` CLI defaults to the chat-template path** (`use_chat_template=True`); legacy raw-completion path is opt-in via the new `--no-chat-template` flag. Routing through the model's native chat template avoids the instruction-tuning artifacts (Qwen3 `<think>` leaks, model re-roleplaying as user, paraphrase loops) that the previous raw-completion `Question:/Answer:` template was triggering. `--system` now routes to `RAGConfig.system_prompt` in chat mode. Library callers stay opt-in for backward compatibility

- **`inferna rag` CLI default `--repetition-threshold` lowered from 3 to 2** so the detector fires on the *first* repeat of a 5-gram. With the previous threshold and the default `--max-tokens 200` the detector never had room to fire on paragraph loops. Pinned by `tests/test_rag_integration.py::TestQwen3RAGLoopRegression::test_cli_default_combo_stops_loop`

- **`inferna rag` CLI default `--max-tokens` raised from 200 to 512** to match `inferna generate` and `inferna chat`. With the loop guard catching runaway loops and the chat-template path avoiding prompt-format meta-restarts, the previous 200-token cap had become the binding constraint on substantive RAG answers (multi-fact summaries, themes paragraphs, etc.) rather than the safety mechanism it was originally sized as

- **`VectorStore.__init__` no longer silently overwrites stored metadata on reopen** - Previously, opening an existing populated DB would `INSERT OR REPLACE` the stored `metric`/`vector_type`/`dimension` with whatever the caller passed in, which could leave the index half-corrupted if the new config didn't actually match the on-disk vectors. Now reopens read the stored metadata first and raise `VectorStoreError` on any hard mismatch (`dimension`, `metric`, `vector_type`) before touching the index. This is the behavioural complement to the new metadata schema in the `Added` section: the same fields that get *recorded* on init are now *verified* on reopen

- **`VectorStore.add()` is now atomic** - The chunk inserts and (when `source_hash` is provided) the source-table insert are wrapped in `with self.conn:` so any failure mid-add rolls back the entire transaction. Previously, an exception after some chunks had been inserted would leave them committed in the DB while the user's code path errored out — producing "phantom chunks" without a corresponding source record. Pinned by `tests/test_rag_store.py::TestVectorStoreSourceDedup::test_atomic_insert_chunks_and_source_in_one_commit`

- **RAG documentation refreshed for the chat-template / persistence / dedup features** - `docs/rag_pipeline.md` gained sections for `RAGConfig.use_chat_template`, `strip_think_blocks`, the n-gram repetition guard, and `IndexResult` / `.skipped_labels`. `docs/rag_vectorstore.md` gained sections on metadata validation (with `VectorStoreError` example) and the `{table}_sources` table API. `docs/rag_overview.md` CLI options table extended with `--db`, `--rebuild`, `--no-chat-template`, `--show-think`, and the `--repetition-*` flags, plus a new "Persistent Vector Store (CLI)" subsection with a behavior decision matrix and a "Generation Defaults Worth Knowing" callout

- **CI workflows consolidated** - The four legacy wheel workflows (`build-cibw.yaml`, `build-cibw-cached.yml`, `build-gpu-wheels.yml`, `build-gpu-wheels-cached.yml`) were removed. The `*2` variants that had been running in parallel as the canonical pipelines (`build-cibw2.yaml` and `build-gpu-wheels2.yaml`) were renamed back into their original slots as `build-cibw.yaml` and `build-gpu-wheels.yml`. Net effect: `.github/workflows/` now contains exactly two wheel workflows instead of six, eliminating drift between the active and legacy paths

### Fixed

- **`inferna rag` crash on Gemma 4 and other models with non-substring-detectable Jinja templates** - llama.cpp's basic `llama_chat_apply_template` C API only handles templates whose embedded Jinja matches one of its hardcoded substring heuristics. Gemma 4 uses `<|turn>` markers (not `<start_of_turn>`), so detection returned `LLM_CHAT_TEMPLATE_UNKNOWN` and `chat()` raised on the first call. **Fixed by the vendored jinja2 renderer** (see `Added` entry above). The pipeline-level system-merge and raw-completion fallbacks added during the investigation (`RAGPipeline._chat_with_fallback`, third-tier raw-completion in `_generate_chunks`) are preserved as defense-in-depth but should rarely fire now

- **`inferna rag` output quality on chat-tuned models (Qwen3 and similar)** - The raw-completion CLI default caused chat-tuned models to leak instruction-tuning artifacts: paragraph paraphrase loops, Qwen3 `<think>` block dumps, and the model re-roleplaying as user. Fixed at five layers: defaulting to the chat-template path, the n-gram repetition detector as a residual-loop safety net, `ThinkBlockStripper` for reasoning blocks (with stateful leading-whitespace stripping re-armed at each close tag so Qwen3's `\n\n`-wrapped blocks don't leave a leading blank line on every answer), a strengthened default system prompt with `/no_think` for Qwen3, and an unconditional `print()` at the end of each interactive turn for visual separation between `> ` prompts. End-to-end verified against `Qwen3-4B-Q8_0.gguf` via `scripts/case/rag-chat1.sh`; pinned by 8 tests in `tests/test_rag_repetition.py::TestThinkBlockStripperLstrip`

- **`inferna rag` / `inferna chat` history file lost after first truncation on libedit-backed Pythons** - libedit (the readline backend on uv-prebuilt CPython on Linux and macOS system Python) has an asymmetric history-file codec: `write_history_file` writes the `_HiStOrY_V2_` magic header on a fresh file but **omits it whenever truncation kicks in** (i.e. whenever the in-memory history exceeds `set_history_length`). libedit's own `read_history_file` then rejects the header-less file with `OSError(EINVAL)`. The atexit-handler `OSError` swallow masked the failure, so users would silently start with empty history on the next session once their REPL accumulated more than `max_entries` entries. Fixed by `_patch_libedit_history_header()` in `inferna._readline`, which detects libedit via `readline.backend == "editline"` and prepends the magic header when it's missing. GNU readline (Debian/Ubuntu system Python) doesn't have the bug and the patch is a no-op there. Pinned by `tests/test_readline.py::TestHistoryRoundTrip::test_max_entries_truncates_on_save`

- **`make qa` mangling vendored jinja2/markupsafe sources** - `ruff check --fix` had no exclude for `src/inferna/_vendor/`, so every `make qa` run was auto-"fixing" upstream code (~778 lines deleted across 19 files in a single run) and emitting bogus `# noqa: B902/B950` warnings for flake8-bugbear codes ruff doesn't recognize. Fixed by adding `extend-exclude = ["src/inferna/_vendor"]` to `[tool.ruff]` in `pyproject.toml`. mypy was already vendor-safe via its scoped paths; `ruff format` honors the same top-level exclude

- **`pytest tests/test_sd.py` crash on macOS Metal after ~5 SDContext lifecycles** - Running the full `test_sd.py` file would either abort (`Fatal Python error: Aborted`, preceded by visible screen-shaking from Metal compositor pressure) or surface `RuntimeError: Image generation failed` from the v0.2.3 validation guardrail. Root cause: five tests let `SDContext` fall out of function scope without explicit cleanup, and pytest frame retention + non-deterministic GC + Metal ARC deferral combine to keep up to five ~6 GB models simultaneously alive, eventually exhausting Metal's working set. Fixed by adding `del ctx; gc.collect()` to each of the five tests, matching the existing `tests/test_memory_leaks.py::TestSDContextLeaks` precedent. Full diagnosis and the 5-cycle reproducer are in `docs/dev/test-cleanup.md`

- **Broken `from conftest import DEFAULT_MODEL` in `tests/test_batching.py` and `tests/test_comprehensive.py`** - Both files failed full-directory collection with `ImportError: cannot import name 'DEFAULT_MODEL' from 'conftest'` because pytest's sys.path ordering put `tests/examples/conftest.py` ahead of the real `tests/conftest.py`. Fixed by adding `"tests"` to `pythonpath` and `norecursedirs = ["examples"]` in `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`. Collection: 1466 / 2 errors → 1463 / 0 errors (−3 is 2 deleted placeholder tests plus the never-actually-a-test `tests/examples/minimal_mongoose_test.py`)

- **Test quality audit guided by `pytest-review`** - Replaced 11 trivial `assert True`/`assert False` placeholders with meaningful state-based assertions (`test_sd.py` callbacks/setters, `test_tts_logic.py` rewrite removing a try/except-around-print anti-pattern and non-ASCII emoji, `test_rag_dedup.py::test_deterministic`). Added real post-operation assertions to ~15 "should not raise" tests across `test_mcp.py`, `test_ngram_cache.py`, `test_rag_store.py`, `test_rag_embedder.py`, `test_rag_splitter.py`, `test_whisper.py`, `test_error_messages.py`, `test_jinja_chat.py`, `test_sampler.py`, `test_platform.py`, and `test_agents_contract.py`. Deleted 2 `pass`-body placeholder tests (`test_cli.py::test_platform_specific_functionality`, `test_speculative.py::test_initialization_incompatible_raises`). pytest-review error count: 84 → ~6 remaining false positives (runtime `pytest.skip(...)` and `@pytest.mark.skip` decorators not recognized as assertion-exempt markers)

## [0.2.4]

### Added

- **Unified CLI** - `inferna` command now exposes all major functionality via subcommands: `generate` (alias `gen`), `chat`, `embed`, `rag`, `server`, `transcribe`, `tts`, `sd`, `agent`, `memory`. The previous `info` and `version` commands are preserved. High-level commands (`generate`, `chat`, `embed`) use the Python API directly; others delegate to existing sub-module CLIs. `chat` and `generate` expose full sampling parameters (`--top-k`, `--top-p`, `--min-p`, `--repeat-penalty`). `embed` supports `--dim`, `--similarity QUERY` with `--threshold`, `--pooling`, `--no-normalize`, and `-c`/`--ctx-size`

- **`inferna rag` CLI** - New `rag` subcommand for command-line retrieval-augmented generation. Index files (`-f`) or directories (`-d`) and query them with a generation model (`-m`) and an embedding model (`-e`). Supports single-query (`-p`) and interactive modes, streaming (`--stream`), source display (`--sources`), configurable retrieval (`-k`, `--threshold`), system instructions (`-s`), and GPU offloading (`-ngl`)

- **CLI Cheatsheet** - New `docs/cli-cheatsheet.md` documenting every flag for all CLI entry points in one place: the unified `inferna` commands (`generate`, `chat`, `embed`, `rag`, `server`, `transcribe`, `tts`, `sd`, `agent`, `memory`, `info`, `version`), all sub-module CLIs (`python -m inferna.<module>`), and the low-level `python -m inferna.llama.cli`

- **`/v1/embeddings` endpoint in PythonServer and EmbeddedServer** - Both server implementations now support the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` endpoint. When `embedding=True` in `ServerConfig`, the server instantiates an `Embedder` to handle embedding requests over HTTP. New config fields: `embedding_model_path` (defaults to `model_path`), `embedding_n_ctx`, `embedding_n_batch`, `embedding_n_gpu_layers`, `embedding_pooling`, and `embedding_normalize`. Accepts single string or batch input, returns OpenAI-format response with usage stats. Resolves [#14](https://github.com/shakfu/inferna/issues/14)

### Fixed

- **CI build failed installing sd-cli from stable-diffusion.cpp** - `cmake --install` tried to install the `sd-cli` executable even though CI only needs the `stable-diffusion` library. The underlying cause was GCC 10 on manylinux2014 missing the `_mm256_cvtsi256_si32` intrinsic, which broke compilation of sd.cpp's vendored libwebp `lossless_avx2.c` when linking `sd-cli`/`sd-server`. Alternative fixes included `SD_WEBP=OFF` to disable webp support or installing `libwebp-devel` in the CI container to use the system library instead. Fixed by adding a `--no-sd-examples` flag to `manage.py build` that sets `SD_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF` at CMake configure time, preventing the examples from being built or installed. All CI workflows and cibuildwheel configs now pass this flag. Local builds still build examples by default

- **Concurrent VectorStore reads fail with "database is locked"** - Opening multiple `VectorStore` instances on the same database file from separate threads failed immediately because `sqlite3.connect()` was called without a `timeout`. The default 0-second wait meant any lock contention during extension loading caused instant failure. Added `timeout=10` to both connection sites (`__init__` and `open`)

- **Ctrl+C during inference now works** - `llama_decode()` was holding the Python GIL, preventing SIGINT handlers from firing during text generation. Released the GIL with `nogil` (matching what `llama_encode()` already did). The CLI also catches `KeyboardInterrupt` for a clean exit instead of a traceback

- **Embedder logging noise** - `Embedder` accepted a `verbose` parameter but never called `disable_logging()`, so llama.cpp model loading output was always printed. Now suppresses logging when `verbose=False` (the default), matching how `LLM` already works

- **Interactive chat responses truncated at 50 tokens** - `Chat.generate()` in `llama/chat.py` had `max_tokens` hardcoded to 50. Now defaults to 512 and is configurable via `-n`/`--max-tokens` on the command line

- **`llama/chat.py` broken import** - `from . import LlamaModel` failed because `llama/__init__.py` does not re-export `llama_cpp` extension classes. Changed to import from `.llama_cpp` directly

- **Stable Diffusion CUDA crash with `--offload-to-cpu`** - Image generation with `--offload-to-cpu` (and optionally `--vae-on-cpu`) crashed with `GGML_ASSERT(ggml_are_same_layout(src, dst))` during tensor copy. Root cause: `libstable-diffusion.a` was compiled against ggml 0.9.5 headers but linked at runtime against llama.cpp's ggml 0.9.8 shared libraries. Between these versions, `GGML_OP_GATED_DELTA_NET` was inserted into the `ggml_op` enum, shifting all subsequent op values by 1. This caused the SD code to build compute graphs with misidentified operations, leading to corrupted tensor layouts. Fixed by replacing SD's vendored ggml with llama.cpp's ggml during the build, ensuring both compile-time and runtime enum values match. The sync is automatic via `_sync_ggml_abi()` in `manage.py` for both local and CI builds

- **Incorrect `mg_event_handler_t` typedef in Mongoose `.pxd`** - The Cython declaration used a 4-argument signature `(c, ev, ev_data, fn_data)` but Mongoose 7.x defines the callback as 3 arguments `(c, ev, ev_data)`. The mismatch was silently harmless at runtime (the extra `fn_data` parameter was never used -- the server accesses `c->mgr->userdata` instead), but it was technically undefined behavior. Fixed the typedef in `mongoose.pxd` and the `_http_event_handler` callback in `embedded.pyx` to match the actual Mongoose header

- **Vulkan cached CI workflow failed to parse environment** - Stray backtick in `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT_LINUX` for the Vulkan job in `build-gpu-wheels-cached.yml` caused cibuildwheel to reject the entire environment block with `Malformed environment option`. The other three backend jobs (CUDA, ROCm, SYCL) were unaffected

- **Stable Diffusion CUDA wheel build failed linking libwebp** - The latest stable-diffusion.cpp release bundles libwebp, whose `lossless_avx2.c` uses `_mm256_cvtsi256_si32` -- an intrinsic missing from GCC 10 (`devtoolset-10` on manylinux_2_28). The linker error only affected `sd-cli` and `sd-server` executables, not `libstable-diffusion.a`. Fixed by building only the `stable-diffusion` library target in CI (where `sd-cli`/`sd-server` are not needed); local builds continue to build all targets

- **SIGILL crash in CI smoke tests** - Wheels built by `build-cibw2` and `build-cibw-cached` crashed with `Illegal instruction (core dumped)` on the smoke-test runner because `GGML_NATIVE` was never set in the cibuildwheel environment. Without the env var, `manage.py` does not pass it to CMake, and CMake defaults to `GGML_NATIVE=ON`, compiling with the build machine's native CPU instructions (e.g. AVX-512) which may not exist on the target runner. Added `GGML_NATIVE = "0"` to the cibuildwheel environment for all three platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) in `pyproject.toml`. Also added `pyproject.toml` to the cache key hash in both cached workflows so stale native-compiled caches are invalidated

### Changed

- **Upgraded llama.cpp from b8429 to b8705** - Updated Cython bindings (`llama.pxd`, `llama_cpp.pyx`) for API changes in the new release. Shared ggml version is now 0.9.11

- **Upgraded stable-diffusion.cpp from master-537-545fac4 to master-558-8afbeb6** - Updated `stable_diffusion.pxd` for new header declarations. The ggml ABI sync (`_sync_ggml_abi()`) ensures SD's vendored ggml stays aligned with llama.cpp's ggml 0.9.11

### Tested

- **Stable Diffusion z-image-turbo text-to-image on Metal** - Successfully generated 1024x512 (H x W) images using `inferna sd txt2img` with z-image-turbo (Q6_K) + Qwen3-4B (Q8_0) + ae.safetensors VAE on macOS M2 Max (32GB). The combined model footprint (~19.5GB VRAM) exceeds the M1's Metal working set limit (~11.5GB), causing `kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorOutOfMemory`. `--offload-to-cpu` does not help when the single largest component (z_image diffusion model, 11.7GB) already exceeds the GPU limit. Requires 32GB+ unified memory for Metal; CPU backend works on smaller machines via swap. This is highlighted here because the metal backend was previously buggy on stable-diffusion.cpp

## [0.2.3]

### Fixed

- **Stable Diffusion `flow_shift` default produced black images** - The `generate()` method and CLI defaulted `flow_shift` to `0.0` instead of `INFINITY`. The C library uses `INFINITY` as a sentinel to apply model-specific defaults (e.g. 3.0 for z-image-turbo, 5.0 for Wan, 1.0 for Flux). With `0.0`, the flow denoiser was effectively disabled, producing black images for all Flow-based models
- **Stable Diffusion generation silently continued on GPU OOM** - When CUDA/Metal memory allocation failed, stable-diffusion.cpp logged errors but returned invalid image data. The Cython wrapper did not validate the results, so it silently produced garbage output. Now validates each `SDImage.is_valid` after generation and raises `RuntimeError` with actionable guidance. Same fix applied to video generation
- **Dynamic build install on Linux** - Shared libraries (`.so`) were not installed alongside Cython extensions on Linux, causing `ImportError: libggml-cpu.so: cannot open shared object file` at runtime. The `CMakeLists.txt` only installed dylibs on macOS (expecting `auditwheel` for wheels), but editable installs via `uv sync` need them in place since extensions use `RUNPATH=$ORIGIN`. Now installs dylibs on all platforms
- **`libggml-cpu.so` missing from dynamic installs** - The CPU link library (`libggml-cpu.so`) was added to the link list but not to `DYLIB_FILES`, so it was never installed alongside the extension even though the extension requires it at runtime. Now added to `DYLIB_FILES` when CPU variants are present
- **`make clean` did not remove `thirdparty/<dep>/dynamic/`** - Stale shared libraries from a previous dynamic build survived `make clean`, potentially causing mismatches when switching between static and dynamic builds. `dynamic/` is now cleaned for all three deps (llama.cpp, whisper.cpp, stable-diffusion.cpp)
- **`make reset` did not remove `.venv`** - A stale editable install with wrong RUNPATH could persist across reset + rebuild cycles. `make reset` now removes `.venv` to ensure a clean environment

- **Crash on failed image generation** - `save_outputs` now skips images with no valid data instead of raising `ValueError: Image has no valid data`. All image generation commands (`txt2img`, `img2img`, `inpaint`, `controlnet`) report a clean error and exit with code 1 when no images are generated successfully (e.g. due to CUDA OOM)
- **`--offload-to-cpu` now enables `free_params_immediately`** - When CPU offloading is requested, model parameters are freed from VRAM immediately after each component finishes, maximizing available VRAM for the next component
- **GPU backend cross-contamination in wheel builds** - All three dep builders (llama.cpp, whisper.cpp, stable-diffusion.cpp) now explicitly set unused GPU backends to `OFF` in CMake, preventing stale cache entries from enabling the wrong backend. This fixes an issue where the Vulkan wheel's `libstable-diffusion.a` could be compiled with `SD_USE_CUDA` instead of `SD_USE_VULKAN`
- **GPU backend discovery in repaired wheels** - Wheel repair tools (`auditwheel` on Linux, `delvewheel` on Windows) append a content hash to bundled library filenames (e.g. `libggml-vulkan.so` → `libggml-vulkan-3e3d7523.so`). ggml's built-in `ggml_backend_load_all_from_path()` could not discover non-variant backends (Vulkan, CUDA, RPC, etc.) after this renaming because they lack the `ggml_backend_score` symbol used by the variant scoring path, and the exact-filename fallback no longer matches. `ggml_backend_load_all()` in all three modules now bypasses ggml's filename-based discovery for wheel repair directories (`inferna*.libs/` on Linux/Windows, `inferna/.dylibs/` on macOS) and loads each backend candidate individually via `ggml_backend_load()`. A shared once-only flag in `_backend_dl.py` prevents duplicate registrations across modules
- **Incorrect ggml version reported for sd.cpp in dynamic builds** - `_write_build_info` reported sd.cpp's vendored ggml version (0.9.5) instead of the shared llama.cpp ggml version (0.9.8) when llama.cpp sources were unavailable (e.g. `--dynamic` builds that download pre-built binaries). Now falls back to whisper.cpp's ggml version (which matches llama.cpp's) and warns if neither is available
- **Cached GPU workflow synced with active workflow** - `build-gpu-wheels-cached.yml` was stale: CUDA job was missing `GGML_NATIVE=OFF` (risking SIGILL on user CPUs) and used the broad architecture list instead of PTX-only `"75"`. All four backends (CUDA, ROCm, SYCL, Vulkan) now match `build-gpu-wheels.yml` settings. Cache keys now hash both `scripts/manage.py` and the workflow file itself, preventing stale binaries after workflow-only changes
- **GPU offload reported as False in dynamic wheels** - `cmd_info()` in `__main__.py` called `llama_backend_init()` but never called `ggml_backend_load_all()` for the llama.cpp section, so the backend registry was empty and `llama_supports_gpu_offload()` returned `False`. The whisper and sd sections already had this call. Now all three sections load backends before querying them
- **whisper/sd backend reporting in `inferna info`** - whisper.cpp parsed its `print_system_info()` string for backend names which only reflects compile-time flags, not dynamically-loaded backends. stable-diffusion.cpp queried the ggml registry through llama. Both now consistently report `built` (from `_backend.py`, what was compiled) and `backends` (from the ggml registry, what is actually loaded and available at runtime)
- **`_backend.py` missing from GPU wheels** - The build-time backend config was generated in `CIBW_BEFORE_ALL_LINUX` but not preserved for the per-Python-version wheel builds, so `_backend.py` was absent at packaging time. `_get_built_backends()` caught the `ImportError` and returned an empty list, causing `inferna info` to report `built: CPU only` even on CUDA/ROCm/SYCL/Vulkan wheels despite backends loading correctly at runtime. Added a `write-backend-info` manage.py command called in `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD_LINUX` for all GPU wheel workflows to regenerate the file from `GGML_*` env vars right before packaging

### Changed

- **`text_to_image()` now returns a single `SDImage`** - The convenience function previously returned `List[SDImage]` with `batch_count` always 1, requiring callers to unpack `images[0]`. It now returns a single `SDImage` directly. The old batch behavior is available via the new `text_to_images()` function, which accepts `batch_count` and returns `List[SDImage]`
- **`inferna` CLI entry point** - Added `[project.scripts]` entry point in `pyproject.toml` so `inferna info` works directly instead of `python -m inferna info`. Updated README and docs accordingly
- **Backend build targets now have static and dynamic variants** - Each backend has both `build-<backend>` (static) and `build-<backend>-dynamic` (dynamic) Makefile targets. Same for wheels: `wheel-<backend>` and `wheel-<backend>-dynamic`. All build targets use `clean` as a prerequisite to avoid stale cmake caches
- **Added OpenCL build targets** - `build-opencl`, `build-opencl-dynamic`, `wheel-opencl`, and `wheel-opencl-dynamic` were missing and are now available

### Added

- **Wheel smoke tests in CI** - New `build-cibw2.yaml` workflow adds a `smoke_test` job that runs after wheel builds on Linux, macOS ARM, and Windows. Installs each platform's wheel in a clean venv and validates: all core imports (API, Cython extensions, agents, integrations, optional whisper/sd), plus a minimal inference call with the 1B test model. Test model is cached across runs via `actions/cache`. Release upload is now gated on smoke test success
- **Build-time backend config (`_backend.py`)** - `manage.py` now generates `src/inferna/_backend.py` alongside `_build_info.py`, recording which GPU backends (CUDA, Metal, Vulkan, HIP, SYCL, OpenCL, BLAS) were enabled and their configuration options (CUDA architectures, compiler, tuning flags, HIP architectures, BLAS vendor, OpenMP). Queryable at runtime via `from inferna import _backend`
- **Windows CUDA DLL discovery** - New `inferna.utils.platform` module with `ensure_native_deps()`, called automatically before native extension loads. On Windows with a CUDA build, registers CUDA toolkit DLL directories via `os.add_dll_directory()` (env vars, PATH, and standard install locations). No-op on other platforms or non-CUDA builds. Guards placed in `llama/__init__.py`, `whisper/__init__.py`, and `sd/__init__.py` so all three backends are covered
- **CUDA performance tuning flags** - `GGML_CUDA_FORCE_MMQ`, `GGML_CUDA_FORCE_CUBLAS`, `GGML_CUDA_PEER_MAX_BATCH_SIZE`, and `GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS` are now forwarded from environment variables to CMake in all three builders (llama.cpp, whisper.cpp, stable-diffusion.cpp)
- **`CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER` passthrough** - Users with multiple CUDA toolkit installations can set `CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/path/to/nvcc` to select a specific compiler
- **Parameterized CUDA version for dynamic builds** - `_release_asset_name()` reads `LLAMACPP_CUDA_RELEASE` env var (default `"12.4"`) instead of hardcoding the CUDA version in the Windows dynamic download asset name
- **`--blas` CLI flag and `GGML_BLAS`/`GGML_BLAS_VENDOR` passthrough** - Enables explicit BLAS backend selection (OpenBLAS, Intel MKL, etc.) for llama.cpp and whisper.cpp builds. Vendor is set via `GGML_BLAS_VENDOR` env var
- **`--no-openmp` CLI flag and `GGML_OPENMP` passthrough** - Allows disabling OpenMP for Arm and embedded builds. Forwarded to all three builders
- **`GGML_HIP_ROCWMMA_FATTN` passthrough** - Enables rocWMMA-accelerated flash attention for AMD GPUs with supported hardware, forwarded to llama.cpp and whisper.cpp builders
- **Build options analysis** - Added `docs/dev/build-options.md` documenting the comparison of local, CI, and upstream llama.cpp build configurations
- **Advanced Build Options guide** - Added `docs/build_options.md` covering CUDA tuning, architecture targeting, BLAS/OpenMP configuration, dynamic linking, Windows builds, and complete environment variable reference
- **`ggml_backend_unload()` exposed in llama_cpp** - New Python-callable function to unload a dynamically-loaded backend by name (e.g. `"Vulkan"`, `"CUDA"`) and unregister it from the ggml backend registry. Only works with backends loaded via `ggml_backend_load_all()` (i.e. `GGML_BACKEND_DL` builds)
- **`GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS` build option** - New `--cpu-all-variants` CLI flag and `GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS=1` env var for `manage.py build`. Builds the ggml-cpu backend for multiple x86 ISAs (AVX, AVX2, AVX512, etc.) as separate shared libraries; the optimal one is selected at runtime. Automatically disables `GGML_NATIVE` (they are incompatible). Requires `GGML_BACKEND_DL` (set automatically by `build_shared`)
- **`GGML_BACKEND_DL` enabled for dynamic builds** - `LlamaCppBuilder.build_shared()` now passes `GGML_BACKEND_DL=ON` to CMake so that GPU backend shared libraries (Vulkan, CUDA, etc.) are built as loadable modules with the `ggml_backend_score` entry point. Without this, `auditwheel`-repaired wheels contained the backend `.so` files but ggml's runtime loader silently skipped them

## [0.2.2]

### Fixed

- **CUDA wheel size stability** - The `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` passthrough added in the previous fix was compiling SASS for 5 architectures plus PTX for 1, producing a 762 MB `libggml-cuda.so`. Changed to `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="75"` (PTX-only for sm_75/Turing), which lets the CUDA driver JIT-compile for the user's actual GPU at runtime. Supports Turing and newer GPUs (RTX 20xx+, T4+), forward-proof for CUDA 13.x which drops pre-Turing support
- **`GGML_NATIVE=OFF` moved from `manage.py` to CI workflows** - The portability flags were previously hardcoded in `manage.py`'s `get_backend_cmake_options()`, affecting local development builds. Now set exclusively in `CIBW_BEFORE_ALL_LINUX` and `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT_LINUX` for all four GPU backends (CUDA, ROCm, SYCL, Vulkan), keeping local builds native while ensuring CI wheels are portable

### Added

- **Automatic GitHub pre-release uploads** - Both `build-cibw` and `build-gpu-wheels` workflows now upload wheels to a GitHub pre-release tagged with the `pyproject.toml` version

### Changed

- **GitHub Release upload is now opt-in** - The `upload_release` job in all four wheel workflows (`build-cibw`, `build-cibw-cached`, `build-gpu-wheels`, `build-gpu-wheels-cached`) is gated behind a new "Upload wheels to GitHub Release" checkbox (default off), preventing accidental releases during test builds
- **Experimental cached CI workflows** - `build-cibw-cached` and `build-gpu-wheels-cached` variants cache `thirdparty/` build artifacts between runs using `actions/cache`, keyed on `scripts/manage.py` hash. On cache hit, `CIBW_BEFORE_ALL` skips the deps build (including shaderc for Vulkan), reducing CI time on unchanged dependencies

## [0.2.1]

### Added

- **Per-request sampler parameters in PythonServer** - `temperature`, `min_p`, and `seed` are now configurable per request via the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint instead of being hardcoded (seed 1337, temp 0.8, min_p 0.05)
- **`GenerationConfig.to_dict()`** - New method that converts a config to a dictionary with mutable values copied, replacing duplicated dict-building logic in `LLM.__init__` and `AsyncLLM._build_config()` (also fixes missing `main_gpu`, `split_mode`, `tensor_split` fields in the async variant)
- **Configurable TTS token IDs** - `TTSGenerator` now accepts `guide_token_id` and `audio_code_range` parameters instead of hardcoding token ID 198 and range 151672-155772 (OuteTTS defaults preserved)
- **Timeout support for `AsyncLLM.stream()`** - New `timeout` parameter (seconds) limits how long the consumer waits for each chunk, raising `asyncio.TimeoutError` if the model stalls
- **Memory-aware LRU cache for embeddings** - `Embedder` now accepts `cache_max_memory_bytes` to cap cache memory usage in addition to count-based eviction. `CacheInfo` includes a `memory_bytes` field

### Tests

- **Concurrent VectorStore access** - Tests verify cross-thread safety: shared instances correctly reject cross-thread use, and separate instances on the same file support concurrent reads and writes
- **DirectoryLoader symlink handling** - Tests cover symlinks to files, directories, broken symlinks, and symlinks pointing outside the base directory
- **Server request validation** - Tests for PythonServer with malformed inputs: missing messages, missing role/content keys, stop word truncation, unknown roles
- **Memory-aware LRU cache** - Unit tests for count-based eviction, memory-based eviction, memory tracking accuracy, and duplicate key handling
- **TextLoader errors parameter** - Tests for invalid and valid codec error handler names
- **`make leaks` RSS-growth leak detector** - New Makefile target runs `scripts/leak_check.py`, which exercises model load/unload and inference in a loop, measuring RSS per cycle and failing if growth exceeds a threshold (default 20%). Detects native memory leaks in Cython wrappers without the false-positive noise of `leaks --atExit` on CPython

### Changed

- **CI Python path auto-discovered in manylinux** - Replaced hardcoded `/opt/python/cp310-cp310/bin/python` in `build-gpu-wheels.yml` with runtime discovery (`ls -d /opt/python/cp3*/bin | head -1`), removing the need for a workflow input
- **Windows `get_lib_path()` searches more build configurations** - Now tries `RelWithDebInfo/`, `MinSizeRel/`, and `Debug/` before falling back, with a warning listing all searched paths
- **CI artifact naming deterministic** - Replaced `strategy.job-index` with `matrix.os` in `build-cibw.yaml` artifact names, preventing name changes when the matrix definition is modified

### Fixed

- **`TextLoader` validates `errors` parameter** - Invalid codec error handler names (e.g. `"invalid"`) now raise `ValueError` at construction time instead of producing a cryptic `LookupError` deep in file I/O
- **CUDA dynamic wheel build failed on missing `libggml-rpc.so`** - `ggml-rpc` was incorrectly listed as a required core library in `CMakeLists.txt`, but it's an optional RPC backend not always present in self-builds or release tarballs. Moved to optional; build warns instead of failing when absent
- **`LLAMACPP_DYLIB_DIR` validated when `WITH_DYLIB=ON`** - CMake now emits `FATAL_ERROR` if the directory does not exist or is empty, instead of silently defaulting to an absent `thirdparty/llama.cpp/dynamic`
- **Broken symlinks in `build_shared()` now logged** - Previously, symlinks with missing targets were silently skipped during shared library collection, potentially producing incomplete wheels. A warning now identifies the broken symlink and its target
- **`sed` package-rename validated in GPU wheel CI** - Each `sed` rename in `build-gpu-wheels.yml` is now followed by a `grep -q` check that fails the build if the pattern did not match, preventing wheels from shipping with the wrong package name
- **`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` directory validated in wheel repair** - `CIBW_REPAIR_WHEEL_COMMAND_LINUX` now checks that the dynamic lib directory exists before running `auditwheel`, instead of silently falling back to system paths
- **Chat message validation in `apply_chat_template()`** - `msg.get("role", "user")` replaced with explicit validation: messages must be dicts with a non-empty string `role` and a present `content` key. Raises `TypeError`/`ValueError` with the offending index
- **`AsyncLLM.stream()` producer task cleanup** - If the consumer raises before the producer starts or finishes, the producer task is now cancelled and awaited cleanly instead of being left dangling
- **GIL released during `whisper_full()` and `llama_encode()`** - Long-running C inference calls now release the GIL, allowing other Python threads to run concurrently during whisper transcription and encoder-decoder encoding
- **Stable diffusion callback exceptions now logged** - `_c_log_callback` and `_c_progress_callback` now log exceptions via `logging.warning` instead of silently swallowing them with bare `except: pass`
- **Overflow-safe image size calculations in stable_diffusion.pyx** - `SDImage.from_numpy()` and `SDImage.load()` now check for integer overflow before `malloc`, raising `OverflowError` instead of silently truncating or allocating undersized buffers
- **`*.a` files excluded from sdist** - `sdist.exclude` in `pyproject.toml` now filters out `thirdparty/*/lib/*.a` and `*.lib` files that were previously included via `sdist.include` of `thirdparty/*/lib` directories
- **`_release_url()` guarded against `None` asset name** - `_release_asset_name()` can return `None` for unsupported platform/backend combinations; `_release_url()` now returns `None` instead of interpolating `"None"` into the URL, and `download_release()` raises a clear `RuntimeError`
- **Invalid chat template names now warn** - When a template name that looks like an identifier (e.g. `"chatml"`) is not found in the model, a `UserWarning` is emitted before falling back to treating it as a raw Jinja string
- **`LLM.__del__` wrapped in try-except** - `close()` called from the destructor can raise during interpreter shutdown or partial initialization; exceptions are now suppressed
- **Shared metadata dicts in `VectorStore.add()`** - `metadata = [{}] * len(embeddings)` replaced with list comprehension to prevent all entries sharing the same dict reference
- **Metadata JSON-serialization validated upfront** - `VectorStore.add()` now validates all metadata dicts are JSON-serializable before starting the insert loop, giving a clear `ValueError` with the offending index
- **HybridStore FTS triggers documented for exclusive access** - `_create_fts_table()` docstring now documents that the INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE triggers require exclusive write access to the SQLite database
- **whisper.cpp CUDA backend not loading** - whisper.cpp was running inference on CPU only because `ggml_backend_load_all()` was never called before creating a `WhisperContext`. Added `ggml_backend_load_all()` to the whisper module (matching llama.cpp's existing pattern) and updated `whisper/cli.py` to call it before context creation
- **whisper.cpp backend detection in `inferna info`** - The info command used outdated `KEY = 1` parsing for whisper backends, but modern whisper.cpp reports dynamically-loaded backends in `BACKEND : feature = val |` format. Fixed to parse the new format and call `ggml_backend_load_all()` before querying
- **stable-diffusion.cpp backend reporting in `inferna info`** - Added `ggml_backend_load_all()` to the sd module so `inferna info` correctly reports GPU backends without relying on llama.cpp having been initialized first
- **Duplicate ggml header conflicts** - `COMMON_INCLUDE_DIRS` included all thirdparty include paths (llama.cpp, whisper.cpp, stable-diffusion.cpp), causing `#pragma once` path-based include guard failures when identical `ggml.h`/`ggml-backend.h` headers existed under multiple directories. Cleaned up so `COMMON_INCLUDE_DIRS` only contains llama.cpp + base dirs; whisper and sd targets now get only their own + llama.cpp's include dirs via per-target configuration
- **Missing malloc NULL checks** - Added NULL checks after `malloc()` in whisper `tokenize()`, llama `tokenize()`, and llama `detokenize()` to raise `MemoryError` instead of crashing on allocation failure
- **Resource leaks in convenience functions** - `complete()`, `chat()`, and `batch_generate()` now use context managers to ensure GPU memory and model resources are freed after use
- **SQL injection risk in VectorStore** - Table names are now validated against `^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$` in `VectorStore.__init__()`, `VectorStore.open()`, and `HybridStore.__init__()` to prevent SQL injection via f-string interpolated identifiers
- **Silent build failures with missing libraries** - Dynamic library discovery in CMakeLists.txt now uses `FATAL_ERROR` instead of `WARNING` when required shared libraries are missing, preventing broken wheels. `copy_lib()` in manage.py now raises `FileNotFoundError` for required libraries instead of silently returning `False`
- **Missing cmake source directory validation** - `cmake_config()` now validates that `src_dir` exists before invoking cmake, raising `FileNotFoundError` instead of producing cryptic cmake errors
- **Unvalidated CI before-build scripts** - `before-build` and `before-all` scripts in pyproject.toml now verify that `manage.py` actually produced libraries before proceeding with wheel builds, preventing broken wheels from silent dependency build failures
- **Illegal instruction crash with pre-built dynamic wheels** - Dynamic builds linked against an arbitrary CPU variant (e.g. `libggml-cpu-alderlake.so`) chosen by non-deterministic GLOB order, which could contain instructions unsupported by the target CPU. Now links against the most portable variant (`x64` then `sse42`) for symbol resolution; ggml's runtime dispatcher still selects the optimal variant for the actual CPU
- **Callback use-after-free in `set_log_callback()`** - The Python callback passed to `llama_log_set()` was not stored, allowing it to be garbage collected while C code still held a pointer. Now kept alive via a module-level reference
- **Missing bounds check in `LlamaBatch.add()`** - Writing past batch capacity caused undefined behavior. Now raises `IndexError` when the batch is full
- **Async event loop race in `AsyncLLM.stream()`** - `asyncio.get_event_loop()` replaced with `asyncio.get_running_loop()` to avoid acquiring the wrong loop after `asyncio.to_thread()`
- **Missing model path validation** - `LLM.__init__()` now raises `FileNotFoundError` early if the model file doesn't exist, instead of failing deep in GPU initialization
- **Division by zero in `Embedder._mean_pool_manual()`** - Returns a zero vector when `n_tokens` is 0 instead of raising `ZeroDivisionError`
- **`VectorStore.open()` lost metric and vector_type** - Store configuration (metric, vector_type, dimension) is now persisted in a `{table}_meta` table and restored on reopen, instead of silently defaulting to cosine/float32. Backwards compatible with databases created before this change

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- **GPU variant packages on PyPI** - Dynamically linked GPU wheels published to PyPI for the first time:
  - `pip install inferna-cuda12` -- NVIDIA GPU (CUDA 12.4, architectures: Volta through Hopper + PTX)
  - `pip install inferna-rocm` -- AMD GPU (ROCm 6.3, requires glibc >= 2.35)
  - `pip install inferna-sycl` -- Intel GPU (oneAPI SYCL 2025.3, requires glibc >= 2.35)
  - `pip install inferna-vulkan` -- Cross-platform GPU (Vulkan, requires glibc >= 2.35)
  - All variants install the same `inferna` Python package (same import, different backends)
  - Dynamic linking reduces wheel sizes to PyPI-publishable levels: CUDA 45MB, ROCm 51MB, Vulkan 28MB, SYCL 84MB

- **Dynamic Linking Support** - New `WITH_DYLIB=1` build mode links against pre-built llama.cpp shared libraries instead of building from source
  - Set `LLAMACPP_DYLIB_DIR=/path/to/release` to point at a pre-built release tarball
  - Shared libraries (`libllama.dylib`, `libggml*.dylib`, `libmtmd.dylib`) are copied alongside the extension for runtime resolution
  - Extension size drops from ~15 MB (static) to ~1.6 MB (dynamic) -- inference engine code is external
  - Static linking (`WITH_DYLIB=OFF`) remains the default and is unchanged

- **Dynamic whisper.cpp linking** - In `WITH_DYLIB` mode, `whisper_cpp` now reuses llama.cpp's ggml shared libraries instead of statically linking its own copy
  - `libwhisper.a` and `libcommon.a` (whisper-specific code) are still linked statically
  - ggml symbols resolve at runtime from the already-bundled `libggml*.dylib` in `inferna/llama/` via `@loader_path/../llama`
  - Eliminates duplicate ggml code in the wheel

- **GPU wheel CI workflow** (`build-gpu-wheels.yml`) - Builds CUDA, ROCm, SYCL, and Vulkan wheels via `cibuildwheel` with both static and dynamic linking modes, with checkbox-based backend selection for parallel builds

- **LlamaContext memory management methods** - Added `memory_seq_rm`, `memory_seq_cp`, `memory_seq_keep`, `memory_seq_add`, `memory_seq_pos_min`, `memory_seq_pos_max` for direct KV cache sequence manipulation

### Changed

- **Eliminated all `common.h`/`libcommon` dependencies** - The Cython extension now uses only public C APIs (`llama.h`, `ggml.h`, `gguf.h`, `mtmd.h`). No internal llama.cpp C++ APIs are linked.
  - **Sampling** -- `CommonSampler` rewritten to build sampler chains via public `llama_sampler_chain_init()` + `llama_sampler_init_*()` with grammar rejection sampling
  - **Speculative decoding** -- `Speculative` class rewritten using `LlamaContext`, `LlamaSampler`, and memory management public APIs
  - **N-gram cache** -- `NgramCache` rewritten as pure Python (`dict`-based, binary-compatible save/load format)
  - **Download functions** -- `get_hf_file`, `download_model`, `list_cached_models`, `resolve_docker_model` rewritten using `urllib.request` (stdlib, no external deps)
  - **Batch helpers** -- `common_batch_add`/`common_batch_clear` inlined as direct array assignment
  - **Parameter conversion** -- `common_context_params_to_llama` inlined as field-by-field assignment

- **Pure Python JSON schema-to-grammar** - Replaced the C++ `json-schema-to-grammar.cpp`/`json-partial.cpp` compilation with a vendored pure Python implementation (`src/inferna/utils/json_schema_to_grammar.py`). This eliminates the need for a llama.cpp source checkout during `build-dynamic`, removes `build_info_stub.cpp` and `json_schema.cpp` C++ helpers, and simplifies the CMake build for both static and dynamic linking modes. Agents import directly from `inferna.utils` instead of going through the llama layer

- **Vendored sqlite-vector source** - sqlite-vector is now vendored in `thirdparty/sqlite-vector/` and built from source via CMake as part of the normal build, replacing the separate `manage.py` build step and pre-built binary copy. This ensures `vector.so` is always included in wheels (including `uv build` sdist->wheel pipeline) without needing `.gitignore` hacks or binary files in the source tree

- **Unified ggml 0.9.8 across all extensions** - Both static and dynamic builds now use llama.cpp's ggml 0.9.8 consistently for llama.cpp, whisper.cpp, and stable-diffusion.cpp (previously SD vendored ggml 0.9.5). In dynamic builds, all extensions share a single set of `libggml*.so`. In static builds, each extension links llama.cpp's ggml static libs (symbols are hidden, so no runtime conflicts). Set `SD_USE_VENDORED_GGML=1` (env var or CMake option) to link stable-diffusion against its own vendored ggml instead; available via `manage.py build --sd-vendored-ggml`

- **Unified GPU backend flags** - All components (llama.cpp, whisper.cpp, stable-diffusion.cpp) now use the same `GGML_*` environment variables for backend selection. Removed the separate `--sd-metal` / `SD_METAL` flag; `GGML_METAL` (and `--metal`) now applies to all components consistently

- **Documentation** - Moved Installation section above Quick Start in README; added feature summary list; updated docs to remove "book" language; fixed Python version requirements (3.10+); updated ROCm/Vulkan backend docs

### Removed

- **OpenSSL linking** -- Removed `find_package(OpenSSL)` from CMake. The embedded server (`cpp-httplib`) does not expose SSL configuration, and the absolute homebrew paths (`/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/`) broke wheel portability on other machines
- **`common.h` wrapper layer** -- Deleted `common.pxd`, `common.pxi`, `sampling.pxi` (~2600 lines). These wrapped the internal `common_params` mega-struct which duplicated the public API configuration path (`LlamaContextParams`, `LlamaSampler`, etc.) and was unused by the Python API or agents
- **Internal C++ declaration files** -- Deleted `chat.pxd`, `log.pxd`, `sampling.pxd`, `download.pxd`, `ngram_cache.pxd`, `speculative.pxd`
- **`CommonParams`, `CommonParamsSampling`** and related wrapper classes -- Use `LlamaContextParams`, `LlamaSampler` instead
- **`CommonSampler`** -- Use `LlamaSampler` with `add_*` methods for the public API path

### Fixed

- **GPU dynamic wheel builds** - Fixed `--dynamic` mode silently downloading CPU-only pre-built binaries for CUDA, ROCm, and SYCL on Linux, where no matching pre-built GPU release assets exist. The build now falls back to compiling llama.cpp from source with `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` and collects the resulting shared libraries (including backend-specific libs like `libggml-cuda.so`) into the dynamic lib directory

- **GPU wheel duplication** - Shared libraries are no longer installed twice in Linux GPU wheels. CMake `install()` of dynamic libs is now macOS-only (`@loader_path`); on Linux, `auditwheel` handles vendoring into `<pkg>.libs/` via `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. This roughly halves CUDA wheel size (81MB -> 45MB compressed)

- **GPU Wheel Import Error** - Fixed `.so` files installing to wrong directory (e.g. `inferna_cuda12/llama/` instead of `inferna/llama/`) by hardcoding install destination to `inferna` instead of using `SKBUILD_PROJECT_NAME` which changed with the package rename

- **ROCm 6.3 Wheel Build** - Fixed multiple issues preventing ROCm wheels from building
  - Patched sqlite-vector to define `_GNU_SOURCE` for `strcasestr` on manylinux/AlmaLinux 8
  - Fixed auditwheel repair by targeting `manylinux_2_35` (matching ROCm 6.3 system requirements) and excluding transitive ROCm runtime libraries

- **Vulkan Wheel Build** - Restructured Vulkan job to build deps inside manylinux_2_28 container
  - Built `glslc` shader compiler from source (Google shaderc) to avoid glibc 2.29 dependency
  - Added `--plat manylinux_2_35_x86_64` for auditwheel repair (gcc-toolset-14 symbol compatibility)

- **SYCL Wheel Build** - Fixed Intel oneAPI installation, compiler selection, and SYCL kernel linking
  - Switched from direct RPM download (403 errors) to Intel YUM repository
  - Pinned to `intel-oneapi-dpcpp-cpp-2025.3` to resolve dependency conflicts
  - Set `CC=icx CXX=icpx` for SYCL compiler support
  - Added `-fsycl` as link-only flag (not compile flag) to preserve SYCL device code from `libggml-sycl.a` without forcing C files to compile as C++

- **CUDA Wheel Size** - Restored CUDA wheels to ~148 MB static (was ~682 MB); dynamic wheels are 45MB
  - Removed `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` passthrough from deps build; llama.cpp defaults use virtual/PTX for older architectures, producing much smaller static libraries
  - Added free disk space step to prevent `strip` failing with "No space left on device"
  - Added `install.strip = true` in pyproject.toml (scikit-build-core default changed in recent versions)
  - Added `--plat manylinux_2_35_x86_64` to auditwheel repair for glibc compatibility

- **sqlite-vector Missing from Wheels** - Added CMake `install(FILES ...)` directive to explicitly include `vector.so`/`vector.dylib` (was excluded by `.gitignore` filtering in scikit-build-core)

- **argparse crash with `--sd-vendored-ggml`** - Fixed `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` when `opt()` was called with `None` as the short option name, which caused `manage.py` to crash on Python 3.10+ in CI

- **`_build_info.py` reported wrong ggml version for stable-diffusion** -- `stable_diffusion_cpp_ggml_version` was read from SD's vendored source (0.9.5) instead of the actually-linked llama.cpp ggml (0.9.8). `_write_build_info` now uses llama.cpp's ggml version as canonical for all backends, unless `SD_USE_VENDORED_GGML=1` is set
- **`common.pxd` struct field mismatch** -- `flash_attn` (bool) corrected to `flash_attn_type` (enum) matching upstream `common_params`
- **`llama.pxd` missing field** -- Added `embeddings` bool to `llama_context_params` (was causing struct layout mismatch)

## [0.1.21]

### Added

- **CLI Info Command** - Added `python -m inferna info` to show build and backend information
  - Displays inferna version, Python version, and platform
  - llama.cpp: ggml version/commit, registered backends (MTL, CUDA, CPU, etc.), device enumeration with type and description, GPU offload/MMAP/MLOCK/RPC support
  - whisper.cpp: version, detected backends, CPU features
  - stable-diffusion.cpp: inferred backends, CPU features
  - Added `ggml_backend_reg_count()`, `ggml_backend_reg_names()`, `ggml_backend_dev_count()`, `ggml_backend_dev_info()` Python wrappers in `llama_cpp.pyx`
  - Added `ggml_backend_reg_name()` declaration to `ggml.pxd`
  - Also supports `python -m inferna version`

- **Code Quality Tooling** - Added Makefile targets and configuration for linting, formatting, and type checking
  - `make lint`: ruff check with auto-fix
  - `make format`: ruff format
  - `make typecheck`: mypy on pure-Python modules (rag, utils)
  - `make qa`: runs lint, typecheck, format in sequence
  - Added `[tool.ruff]` config in `pyproject.toml`: line-length 120, per-file ignores for `__init__.py` re-exports, test relaxations, agents/api conditional imports
  - Added `[tool.mypy]` config: Python 3.10 target, ignore missing imports, `--follow-imports=skip` for Cython-dependent modules
  - Fixed all lint errors and type check errors across the codebase

### Fixed

- **Cross-Platform Wheel Build (cibuildwheel)** - Fixed numerous issues for CI wheel builds across all platforms
  - Fixed circular import in `inferna/llama/__init__.py` by making all imports lazy via `__getattr__` (installed wheels have different import semantics than editable installs)
  - Fixed cibuildwheel test pythonpath: cleared `pythonpath=` override so installed wheel is used instead of source tree
  - Added `pytest-mock` and `pytest-asyncio` to cibuildwheel `test-groups` (uses `dev` dependency group via cibuildwheel v3.4.0 `test-groups` feature)
  - Fixed Linux manylinux2014 build: installed cmake/ninja via pip (yum cmake 2.8 too old), used `/opt/python/cp310-cp310/bin/python` (system Python 3.6 too old for `list[str]` syntax in manage.py), added `git` to container
  - Fixed Linux `lib64` vs `lib` issue: added `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR="lib"` to whisper.cpp and stable-diffusion.cpp cmake configs
  - Fixed Linux httplib undefined symbol: added `libcpp-httplib.a` to `--whole-archive` link group (GNU linker requires this for static lib symbol resolution)
  - Fixed macOS delocate OpenSSL conflict: excluded `libssl`/`libcrypto` from delocate bundling (Homebrew OpenSSL targets macOS 15.0, incompatible with wheel target 11.0)
  - Enabled `LLAMA_OPENSSL=ON` in manage.py for HTTPS support in cpp-httplib
  - Fixed Windows 32-bit: skipped `*-win32` and `*-manylinux_i686` builds (C++ backends are 64-bit only)
  - Fixed Windows `delvewheel` not found: added `pip install delvewheel` to Windows `before-build`
  - Fixed Windows ngram cache crash: skip `test_ngram_cache.py` on Windows (C++ divide-by-zero bug)
  - Fixed Windows temp file locking: moved `os.unlink` outside `NamedTemporaryFile` context in `test_tts_logic.py`
  - Fixed SQLite extension loading: added `hasattr` check for `enable_load_extension` in RAG store tests (CI Python may lack extension support)
  - Added `collect_wheels` job to `build-cibw.yaml` to combine all platform wheels into single downloadable artifact
