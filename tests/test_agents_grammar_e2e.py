"""End-to-end verification that ConstrainedAgent's GBNF grammar actually
constrains real-model output to valid tool-call JSON.

The existing `tests/test_agents_constrained.py` suite uses MockLLM, which
short-circuits the grammar pipeline entirely — so a green ConstrainedAgent
test does not prove that grammar enforcement works against a real sampler.
This module fills that gap with one slow integration test against the
standard `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf` fixture.

What it asserts
---------------
The grammar-enforcement claim is "every generation step produces JSON
conforming to the answer-or-tool envelope". It is *not* about which
branch of the envelope (`tool_call` vs `answer`) the model picks —
that's a behavioral choice that the small 1B test model makes
inconsistently. The test therefore:

1. Runs the agent and collects all events.
2. Asserts no parse-failure ERROR events were emitted. If the grammar
   weren't enforced, the upstream JSON parser would fail on free text
   and we'd see `Failed to parse JSON response` ERRORs.
3. Asserts at least one envelope-conforming event landed (ACTION or
   ANSWER), so we know generation actually ran.
4. For every ACTION event, validates `metadata` against the tool
   registry — confirming `tool_name` is registered and `tool_args` only
   contains declared parameter names.
