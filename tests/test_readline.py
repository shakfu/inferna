"""Tests for the inferna._internal.readline history helper.

Readline behaviour itself can't be fully tested without a real
interactive terminal, but the parts of the helper that don't depend on
tty input -- file path resolution, history file persistence,
round-tripping through the libedit/libreadline file format, missing/
corrupt history file handling, parent directory creation -- are all
unit-testable and pinned here so a future change to the helper can't
silently break history persistence for interactive users.
