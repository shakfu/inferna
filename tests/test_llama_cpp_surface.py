"""Parity test for the `llama.llama_cpp` public surface.

This test pins the names the rest of the package — most importantly the
agent module — depends on. It exists primarily to catch drift between the
sibling projects: inferna (Cython) and inferna (nanobind) both expose
`<pkg>.llama.llama_cpp` as the public binding facade, and shared Python
code does `from ..llama.llama_cpp import LlamaSampler` etc. without
caring which binding strategy backs it.

If a new method is added to `LlamaSampler` in one project but the other
project's facade isn't updated to re-export it, agent code breaks in
that project alone. The discoverable failure mode is "agent works in
inferna but AttributeErrors in inferna" — exactly the kind of bug that
shared-source porting can hide. Running the same test in both repos
detects the gap mechanically.

The list below is the *minimum* surface the agent + api + batching
modules need. Add to it whenever a new dependency is introduced.
