# Agent patterns in inferna

This document maps the canonical agent patterns from the literature onto
their inferna implementations. Each entry says:

- **Status** — first-class primitive, recipe (composes existing primitives),
  or not supported.
- **How to do it** — the actual inferna API call or recipe sketch, with
  pointers to source files.
- **Gap** — what's missing, if anything.

For the broader question "should I use schema or contracts for X?" see
[`contracts.md`](contracts.md) and [`../dev/contract-agent.md`](../dev/contract-agent.md).

## 1. ReAct (Reason + Act)

**Status: first-class primitive.**
Reference: *ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models*
(Yao et al., 2022).

```python
from inferna import LLM
from inferna.agents import ReActAgent, tool

@tool
def search(query: str) -> str: ...

agent = ReActAgent(llm=LLM("model.gguf"), tools=[search])
result = agent.run("What is the capital of France?")
```

Implementation: `src/inferna/agents/react.py`. The loop alternates
THOUGHT / ACTION / OBSERVATION events emitted on the stream. Loop
detection (`_loop_detection.py`) catches stuck patterns; coercion
(`tools.coerce_args`) catches malformed arguments before dispatch;
timeouts (`Tool.timeout`) cap individual tool calls.

**Gap**: none. This is the strongest pattern in the framework.

---

## 2. Plan-and-Execute

**Status: recipe (composes `ConstrainedAgent` + `agent_as_tool`).**
Reference: *Plan-and-Solve Prompting* (Wang et al., 2023).

A planner agent emits a structured task list; a supervisor dispatches
each task to a worker (in-process via `agent_as_tool` or a single
ReActAgent shared across calls). inferna doesn't ship a canned
`PlanAndExecute` class, but the primitives compose cleanly:

```python
# Sketch (not in inferna; ~40 LoC to write yourself):
from inferna.agents import ConstrainedAgent, ReActAgent, agent_as_tool, tool

# Planner emits {"steps": [...]} via grammar-constrained generation.
planner = ConstrainedAgent(llm=planner_llm, tools=[])
plan = planner.run("Refactor module X to use new pattern Y")
# plan.answer parses to a structured list

# Executor runs each step.
executor = ReActAgent(llm=worker_llm, tools=[read_file, edit_file])
results = [executor.run(step) for step in steps]
```

**Gap**: no canned helper. A `plan_and_execute(planner, executor, task,
plan_schema)` function in `composition.py` (~50 LoC) would crystallize
this. See gap-list priority #4.

---

## 3. Reflection / Reflexion

**Status: recipe (composes two `AgentProtocol` instances), no canned
helper.**
Reference: *Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement
Learning* (Shinn et al., 2023).

A worker emits a draft; a critic agent (different system prompt,
possibly same LLM) emits acceptance or revision; loop up to N times.
Pure composition:

```python
# Sketch (~50 LoC to write yourself):
worker = ReActAgent(llm=llm, tools=tools, system_prompt=WORKER_PROMPT)
critic = ReActAgent(llm=llm, tools=[], system_prompt=CRITIC_PROMPT)

for attempt in range(max_attempts):
    draft = worker.run(task).answer
    verdict = critic.run(f"Critique this draft: {draft}").answer
    if "ACCEPT" in verdict:
        return draft
    task = f"{task}\n\nPrior attempt: {draft}\nCritic said: {verdict}"
```

**Gap**: no canned `ReflectionLoop(worker, critic, max_attempts)`
helper. Common production pattern for accuracy-critical tasks — coding
agents, scientific reasoning, factual lookup. See gap-list priority #1.

---

## 4. Tree of Thoughts (ToT)

**Status: not supported.**
Reference: *Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large
Language Models* (Yao et al., 2023).

ToT requires forking the generation state at each thought node and
exploring multiple branches before committing — typically with
KV-cache snapshotting so divergent branches don't recompute the shared
prefix. inferna's public API does not expose KV-cache snapshot /
restore primitives, and the agent loops are linear (single stream of
events, no branching).

Implementing ToT would require: (a) public `LlamaContext.snapshot()` /
`restore()` (currently absent), and (b) a branching agent loop that
maintains a frontier of candidate states with scoring. Significant new
machinery; non-trivial value for inferna's typical user.

**Gap**: structurally hard. See gap-list — explicitly **not on the
roadmap** unless a use case forces it.

---

## 5. Multi-Agent Systems

**Status: first-class primitives.**

Two building blocks in `src/inferna/agents/composition.py`:

- **`agent_as_tool(agent, name, description)`** — wraps any
  `AgentProtocol` instance as a `Tool` so a supervisor can dispatch to
  it through the normal ReAct flow.
- **`TieredAgentTeam(supervisor, workers)`** — ergonomic container for
  supervisor + named workers, each potentially on a different LLM
  (capability tiering).

```python
from inferna.agents import ReActAgent, AgentRole, TieredAgentTeam

team = TieredAgentTeam(
    supervisor=ReActAgent(llm=LLM("strong.gguf"), tools=[]),
    workers=[
        AgentRole("researcher", researcher, "Find facts."),
        AgentRole("coder", coder, "Modify code."),
    ],
)
result = team.run("Refactor X using technique Y.")
```

Sub-agent events surface in the supervisor's stream with `source` and
`parent_event_id` annotations (`AgentEvent` fields) when a
`forward_events` callback is supplied. See [`agents_overview.md`](../agents_overview.md#multi-agent-composition)
for the full reference.

**Gap**: cross-process / cross-host agents (sub-agent running behind
MCP). The primitives are in-process only. See gap-list priority #5.

---

## 6. Memory-Augmented Agents

**Status: partial — short-term and episodic memory only.**

inferna ships three session-storage backends in
`src/inferna/agents/session.py`:

- `MemorySessionStore` — in-process dict, lost at process end.
- `FileSessionStore` — JSON files on disk; multi-process via OS locks.
- `SqliteSessionStore` — SQLite-backed, supports concurrent readers.

Each stores `Message` records, `ToolCallRecord` records, and
`Permission` records keyed by session id. This covers short-term
(within a run) and episodic (across runs) memory.

**Gaps**:

1. **No semantic memory wiring.** Cyllama has a full RAG subsystem
   (`src/inferna/rag/`) but it isn't integrated into agents as a
   memory layer. Users have to manually wrap a RAG retriever as a
   `@tool`. See gap-list priority #2.
2. **No long-term profile primitive.** Cross-session
   "remember the user's preferences" semantics — common in production
   chatbots — has no canned API. See gap-list priority #3.

---

## 7. Retrieval-Augmented Agents (RAG agents)

**Status: partial — RAG subsystem exists, agent integration is
user-side recipe.**

inferna ships a complete RAG pipeline in `src/inferna/rag/`:

- `RAG` and `RAGPipeline` in `rag.py` / `pipeline.py`
- Embedder, splitter, loaders, advanced query helpers
- Multiple vector-store backends in `store.py`

But the bridge to the agent layer is user code:

```python
from inferna.rag import RAGPipeline
from inferna.agents import tool, ReActAgent

rag = RAGPipeline(...)

@tool
def search_kb(query: str, top_k: int = 5) -> list[str]:
    """Search the knowledge base."""
    return [hit.content for hit in rag.query(query, top_k=top_k)]

agent = ReActAgent(llm=llm, tools=[search_kb])
```

**Gap**: a `rag_as_tool(rag_pipeline, name, description, top_k)`
helper in `composition.py` (~20 LoC) would crystallize the recipe and
avoid a class of user mistakes (forgetting to deduplicate, wrong
return type, no result-limit). See gap-list priority #2.

---

## 8. Autonomous / AutoGPT-style

**Status: not supported, by design.**

The Auto-GPT / BabyAGI pattern is recursive goal decomposition with
no external bound: the agent generates its own subgoals, executes
them, generates more subgoals, etc. The literature consistently
reports goal drift, infinite loops, cost explosion, and unreliability.

inferna's design leans in the opposite direction:

- `ReActAgent.max_iterations` caps every run (default 10).
- `_loop_detection.py` actively terminates runs that show signs of
  repetition.
- `ContractAgent` lets you express *budget invariants*
  (`elapsed_ms < 30_000`, `tool_calls < 20`, `errors < 3`) that
  enforce hard ceilings.

These are the *opposite* of what an autonomous agent needs. If you
genuinely want unbounded goal-decomposition, inferna is the wrong
framework — use an explicitly autonomy-oriented one and accept the
trade-offs.

**Gap**: not on the roadmap. Documented here so readers know the
framework's stance.

---

## 9. Workflow / State-Machine Agents

**Status: not supported.**

Frameworks like LangGraph model agent behavior as an explicit DAG or
state machine — nodes are tools or LLM calls, edges encode transitions,
state is threaded through. inferna's agent loops are linear (single
THOUGHT/ACTION/OBSERVATION stream); the multi-agent composition is
hierarchical (supervisor dispatching to workers via tools), not
graph-based.

Building DAG orchestration on top of inferna is possible
(`AsyncReActAgent` + your own orchestrator), but no graph DSL is
shipped.

**Gap**: significant. Adding graph orchestration is a big design
conversation: do we ship a DSL (locks in shape), depend on an
external library (breaks the zero-dependency charter), or stay
linear-only? See gap-list — explicitly **deferred** until a real use
case demands it.
