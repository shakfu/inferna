    """SQLite-based vector store using sqlite-vector extension.

    Inherits from :class:`VectorStoreProtocol` to make the contract
    explicit and to get static enforcement that the seven required
    methods stay in sync with the protocol. Subclassing a
    ``runtime_checkable`` protocol is supported (PEP 544); the class
    behaves as a regular concrete type, the protocol membership only
    affects type-checking.

    .. note::
       Originally named ``VectorStore``. The legacy name is preserved
       as a module-level alias (``VectorStore = SqliteVectorStore``) so
       existing ``from inferna.rag import VectorStore`` imports keep
       working. New code should prefer ``SqliteVectorStore`` -- the
       backend-specific name makes the multi-backend story (with
       Qdrant / Chroma / pgvector adapters via
       :class:`VectorStoreProtocol`) easier to follow.

    VectorStore provides high-performance vector similarity search using the
    sqlite-vector extension. It supports multiple distance metrics and can
    handle large datasets efficiently through quantization.

    Example:
        >>> with VectorStore(dimension=384) as store:
        ...     store.add([[0.1, 0.2, ...]], ["Hello world"])
        ...     results = store.search([0.1, 0.2, ...], k=5)
        ...     print(results[0].text)

        >>> # Persistent storage
        >>> store = VectorStore(dimension=384, db_path="vectors.db")
        >>> store.add(embeddings, texts, metadata=[{"source": "doc1"}])
        >>> store.close()

        >>> # Re-open existing store
        >>> store = VectorStore.open("vectors.db")
