"""Readline history setup for inferna's interactive REPLs.

This module exists to enable up/down-arrow history cycling, in-line
editing (Ctrl-A / Ctrl-E / Ctrl-R / etc.), and persistent history files
for the interactive modes of ``inferna rag``, ``inferna chat``, and any
other future REPL-style command.

The actual mechanism is the standard library's :mod:`readline` module:
just importing it transparently upgrades Python's built-in :func:`input`
to use libreadline (or libedit on macOS) for line editing, with no
other code changes required. This module's only job is to wire up
history file persistence and to gracefully no-op on platforms where
``readline`` isn't available.

Why a dedicated module rather than inlining the few lines into each
caller: the helper is shared between :mod:`inferna.__main__` (which
hosts ``cmd_rag``'s interactive loop) and :mod:`inferna.llama.chat`
(which has its own ``chat_loop``), so a single source of truth avoids
the two paths drifting apart.

    """Enable readline + persistent history for the calling REPL.

    After this call returns, Python's built-in :func:`input` will:

    * cycle through prior entries with the up/down arrow keys,
    * support basic line editing (left/right arrows, Ctrl-A / Ctrl-E,
      Ctrl-R reverse search, etc.),
    * load history from ``history_path`` on startup, and
    * write the (possibly truncated) history back to ``history_path``
      on interpreter shutdown via an :mod:`atexit` handler.

    The function is idempotent in the sense that calling it twice with
    the same path is harmless: the second call re-reads the same file
    and registers a second :mod:`atexit` handler. Callers should
    typically only call it once per process.

    Args:
        history_path: Path to the history file. Tildes are expanded
            via :func:`os.path.expanduser`. The parent directory is
            created if it doesn't exist.
        max_entries: Maximum number of entries kept in memory and
            written to disk. Older entries are dropped. Default 1000,
            which is the same default the standard CPython interactive
            shell uses.

    Returns:
        ``True`` if readline was successfully enabled (the common
        case on macOS and Linux). ``False`` on platforms where the
        :mod:`readline` module is not available -- notably Windows,
        where users can install ``pyreadline3`` to get the same
        behaviour, but inferna does not require it. Returning ``False``

    exposed publicly so callers can flush history mid-session if they
    want. It's also the right entry point for any code that needs to
    "snapshot" history outside the normal exit path.

    The function transparently applies the libedit magic-header
    workaround (see :func:`_patch_libedit_history_header`), so a write
    here is guaranteed to round-trip through ``read_history_file`` on
    the same machine -- including the case where the in-memory history
    exceeds the stifled length and libedit's own writer would otherwise
    produce an unreadable file.

    libedit (used as the readline backend by uv-prebuilt CPython on

    history-file codec: ``write_history_file`` writes the
    ``_HiStOrY_V2_`` magic header on the *first* line of a fresh file,
    but **omits the header whenever truncation kicks in** (i.e. whenever
    the in-memory history exceeds the value passed to
    :func:`readline.set_history_length`). The next call to
    ``read_history_file`` then sees a header-less file, rejects it, and
    raises ``OSError(EINVAL)``.

    The net effect on inferna users on libedit-backed Pythons: once
    their REPL accumulates enough entries to trigger truncation, the
    *entire* history file becomes unreadable on the next session, and
    they silently start over. This workaround prepends the magic header
