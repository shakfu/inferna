"""Internal model file validation helpers.

Used across inferna modules to surface clear, actionable errors for the
common failure modes (missing file, unreadable file, wrong format, empty
file, truncated header, absurd context size) before handing the path to
the underlying C++ libraries, which otherwise tend to fail with opaque
NULL-pointer returns, raw assertions, or — worst of all — segfaults that
the caller cannot catch.

The audit goal is "no segfaults from bad inputs", and the only reliable
way to enforce that from inside a single process is to refuse the bad
input *before* it crosses the FFI boundary.
