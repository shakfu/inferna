"""Multi-agent composition primitives.

This module hosts the building blocks that let one agent invoke another
and the canonical pattern helpers built on top of them. The design intent
is to *not* introduce a new orchestration engine -- multi-agent patterns
compose out of small primitives:

**Base primitives:**

1. :func:`agent_as_tool` -- wrap any :class:`AgentProtocol` as a
   :class:`Tool` so it can be invoked through the ordinary ReAct
   dispatch path. Zero changes to existing agent loops.
2. :class:`TieredAgentTeam` -- ergonomic shorthand for supervisor /
   worker setups where roles run on different LLMs (planner + workers
   with capability-tiered models).

**Pattern helpers (each ~50 LoC over the primitives):**

3. :class:`ReflectionLoop` -- worker emits draft, critic emits
   ACCEPT/revision, loop up to N times. The Reflexion pattern.
4. :func:`plan_and_execute` -- planner emits structured task list,
   executor runs each step sequentially. The Plan-and-Execute pattern.
5. :func:`mcp_agent_tool` -- cross-process analog of :func:`agent_as_tool`
   wrapping a remote agent exposed via MCP.
6. :func:`rag_as_tool` -- bridges the :mod:`inferna.rag` subsystem to
   the agent layer as a canned knowledge-base tool.

Event nesting: when an agent is invoked via :func:`agent_as_tool`, its
events are re-emitted in the supervisor's stream with
``AgentEvent.source`` set to the inner agent's name and
``parent_event_id`` linked to the supervisor's ACTION event. Streaming
UIs see a hierarchical trace; legacy consumers that ignore those fields
behave unchanged.

See ``docs/agents/patterns.md`` for the full pattern catalog and the
ones the framework intentionally does not support.

    """Wrap an :class:`AgentProtocol` as a :class:`Tool`.

    The returned tool, when called with ``{<task_param>: "..."}``,
    invokes ``agent.run(task)`` and returns the answer. The wrapped tool
    fits naturally into any agent's tool registry: a supervisor can
    dispatch to it through the same ReAct / Constrained pipeline it uses
    for ordinary tools, with coercion, timeouts, contracts, and event
    streaming all working unchanged.

    Args:
        agent: Any object satisfying :class:`AgentProtocol` -- typically
            another :class:`ReActAgent` / :class:`ConstrainedAgent` /
            :class:`ContractAgent`. Loop ergonomics are preserved because
            the wrapping uses ``agent.run`` (not ``agent.stream``).
        name: The tool name as it will appear to the supervisor.
            Conventionally lower_snake_case; the ``[\\w./\\-]+`` regex in
            ``ReActAgent._parse_action`` permits namespaced forms like
            ``team/researcher`` too.
        description: Tool description shown to the supervisor LLM. Should
            describe the sub-agent's purpose so the supervisor can decide
            when to route to it.
        task_param: Name of the keyword argument the supervisor must
            supply with the sub-task. Defaults to ``"task"``; override if
            you want something more semantic (``"question"``, ``"query"``,
            etc.).
        forward_events: Optional callback invoked once per event from the
            sub-agent's stream, *in addition to* receiving the final
            answer. Lets a UI render the sub-agent's reasoning even
            though the parent dispatch path only sees a string return
            value. The callback is passed an :class:`AgentEvent` with
            ``source`` set to the agent's name.

    Returns:
        A :class:`Tool` that, when called, executes the wrapped agent.

    convenience layer over :func:`agent_as_tool` -- it wraps every worker
    role as a tool and registers them all on the supervisor.

    The supervisor itself is the user's responsibility: pass any
    :class:`AgentProtocol` that can accept additional tools. Typically
    that's a :class:`ReActAgent` (its ``registry.register`` method is the
    extension point), but the team class doesn't depend on the concrete
    type.

    Example::

    GPU budgeting (multi-model setups): loading two 7B+ models is rarely
    viable on consumer hardware. Typical configurations are one large +
    N small, or model-swapping (one LLM in VRAM at a time, sequential
    dispatch). See ``inferna/memory.py`` for sizing utilities.

class ReflectionLoop:
    """Worker + critic loop -- the Reflexion pattern.

    A worker agent produces a draft answer; a critic agent reviews it and
    either accepts (returns the draft) or returns revision feedback that
    the worker incorporates on the next pass. Loops up to ``max_attempts``
    times, returning the final draft regardless of acceptance.

    The critic is just another :class:`AgentProtocol` -- typically a
    :class:`ReActAgent` with a different system prompt focused on
    critique. The acceptance check is a simple substring match on the
    critic's answer (case-insensitive); pass a custom ``acceptance_marker``
    if you need different framing than ``"ACCEPT"``.

    A planner agent emits a structured task list; the executor runs each

    in order.

    The planner is typically a :class:`ConstrainedAgent` whose grammar
    forces a JSON list (or a :class:`ReActAgent` whose answer is parsed
    by a custom ``plan_parser``). The executor is any
    :class:`AgentProtocol` -- often a single :class:`ReActAgent` reused

        planner: Agent that emits the plan. Its ``answer`` string is fed
            to ``plan_parser`` to produce a list of step strings.
        executor: Agent that runs each step. Called once per step with
            the step string as input.

    Wraps an MCP-exposed agent endpoint as a local :class:`Tool` that
    dispatches via :class:`McpClient.call_tool`. The supervisor doesn't
    know or care whether the sub-agent is local Python, a remote Python
    service, or a totally different runtime -- as long as it speaks MCP.

        task_param: Name of the parameter passed to the remote agent.

            ordinary ``Tool.timeout`` mechanism. Network-level timeouts
            on the MCP transport are separate.

    Returns:
        A :class:`Tool` whose ``name`` is ``"{server_name}/{agent_name}"``
        -- the format the action parser supports for namespaced tools.

    Failure modes map onto the existing exception taxonomy:
    :class:`ToolTimeoutError` for the local budget,
    ``RuntimeError`` from MCP for network/remote failures (caught by
    the agent's generic exception handler and surfaced as ERROR).

        name: Tool name. Default ``"search_kb"``.

        formatter: Callable ``(results) -> str`` producing the
