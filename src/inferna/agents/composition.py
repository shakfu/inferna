"""Multi-agent composition primitives.

This module hosts the small set of building blocks that let one agent
invoke another. The design intent (per ``AGENT_TOOL_REVIEW.md`` proposal
#18 and following) is to *not* introduce a new orchestration engine --
instead, every multi-agent pattern composes out of two primitives:

1. :func:`agent_as_tool` -- wrap any :class:`AgentProtocol` as a
   :class:`Tool` so it can be invoked through the ordinary ReAct
   dispatch path. Zero changes to existing agent loops.
2. :class:`TieredAgentTeam` -- ergonomic shorthand for supervisor /
   worker setups where roles run on different LLMs (planner + workers
   with capability-tiered models).

Patterns like plan-and-execute, critic/refinement, and parallel fan-out
are recipes on top of these primitives, not new framework features.

Event nesting: when an agent is invoked via :func:`agent_as_tool`, its
events are re-emitted in the supervisor's stream with
``AgentEvent.source`` set to the inner agent's name and
``parent_event_id`` linked to the supervisor's ACTION event. Streaming
UIs see a hierarchical trace; legacy consumers that ignore those fields
behave unchanged.

    """Wrap an :class:`AgentProtocol` as a :class:`Tool`.

    The returned tool, when called with ``{<task_param>: "..."}``,
    invokes ``agent.run(task)`` and returns the answer. The wrapped tool
    fits naturally into any agent's tool registry: a supervisor can
    dispatch to it through the same ReAct / Constrained pipeline it uses
    for ordinary tools, with coercion, timeouts, contracts, and event
    streaming all working unchanged.

    Args:
        agent: Any object satisfying :class:`AgentProtocol` -- typically
            another :class:`ReActAgent` / :class:`ConstrainedAgent` /
            :class:`ContractAgent`. Loop ergonomics are preserved because
            the wrapping uses ``agent.run`` (not ``agent.stream``).
        name: The tool name as it will appear to the supervisor.
            Conventionally lower_snake_case; the ``[\\w./\\-]+`` regex in
            ``ReActAgent._parse_action`` permits namespaced forms like
            ``team/researcher`` too.
        description: Tool description shown to the supervisor LLM. Should
            describe the sub-agent's purpose so the supervisor can decide
            when to route to it.
        task_param: Name of the keyword argument the supervisor must
            supply with the sub-task. Defaults to ``"task"``; override if
            you want something more semantic (``"question"``, ``"query"``,
            etc.).
        forward_events: Optional callback invoked once per event from the
            sub-agent's stream, *in addition to* receiving the final
            answer. Lets a UI render the sub-agent's reasoning even
            though the parent dispatch path only sees a string return
            value. The callback is passed an :class:`AgentEvent` with
            ``source`` set to the agent's name.

    Returns:
        A :class:`Tool` that, when called, executes the wrapped agent.

class TieredAgentTeam:
    """Supervisor + worker team with optional capability tiering.

    A common multi-agent pattern: a strong "planner" model decides which
    specialised worker to dispatch to, and each worker may run on a
    different (often smaller / cheaper) LLM. This class is a thin
    convenience layer over :func:`agent_as_tool` -- it wraps every worker
    role as a tool and registers them all on the supervisor.

    The supervisor itself is the user's responsibility: pass any
    :class:`AgentProtocol` that can accept additional tools. Typically
    that's a :class:`ReActAgent` (its ``registry.register`` method is the
    extension point), but the team class doesn't depend on the concrete
    type.

    Example::

        from inferna import LLM
        from inferna.agents import ReActAgent
        from inferna.agents.composition import AgentRole, TieredAgentTeam

        researcher = ReActAgent(llm=LLM("models/fast.gguf"), tools=[...])
        coder = ReActAgent(llm=LLM("models/code.gguf"), tools=[...])

        )
        result = team.run("Refactor X using technique Y.")

    GPU budgeting (multi-model setups): loading two 7B+ models is rarely
    viable on consumer hardware. Typical configurations are one large +
    N small, or model-swapping (one LLM in VRAM at a time, sequential
    dispatch). See ``inferna/memory.py`` for sizing utilities.
